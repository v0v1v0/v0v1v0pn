<h2>Arsenic concentrations in Manoa Stream, Oahu Hawaii</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Arsenic concentrations (ug/L) in an urban stream, Manoa Stream at Kanewai
Field, on Oahu, Hawaii.
</p>
<p>Objective is to characterize conditions by computing summary statistics.
</p>
<p>There are three detection limits, at 0.9, 1, and 2 ug/L.  Uncensored
values reported below the lowest detection limit indicate that informative
censoring may have been used, and so the results are likely biased high.
Used in Chapter 6 of the NADA book.
