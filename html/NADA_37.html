<h2>
Regression by Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Left-censored Data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Regression by Maximum Likelihood (ML) Estimation for left-censored
("nondetect" or "less-than") data.  This routine computes regression
estimates of slope(s) and intercept by maximum likelihood
when data are left-censored.  It will compute ML estimates of
descriptive statistics when explanatory variables following the ~
are left blank.  It will compute ML tests similar in function and
assumptions to two-sample t-tests and analysis of variance when
groups are specified following the ~.  It will compute regression
equations, including multiple regression, when continuous explanatory
variables are included following the ~.  It will compute the ML
equivalent of analysis of covariance when both group and continuous
explanatory variables are specified following the ~.  To avoid
an appreciable loss of power with regression and group hypothesis
tests, a probability plot of residuals should be checked to ensure
that residuals from the regression model are approximately gaussian.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">    cenmle(obs, censored, groups, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>obs</code></td>
<td>

<p>Either a numeric vector of observations or a formula.
See examples below.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>censored</code></td>
<td>

<p>A logical vector indicating TRUE where an observation in ‘obs’ is
censored (a less-than value) and FALSE otherwise.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>groups</code></td>
<td>

<p>A factor vector used for grouping ‘obs’ into subsets.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>Additional items that are common to this function and the <code>survreg</code>
function from the ‘survival’ package.  The most important of which
is ‘dist’ and ‘conf.int’.  See Details below.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This routine is a front end to the <code>survreg</code> routine in the
<code>survival</code> package.  
</p>
<p>There are many additional options that are supported and documented
in <code>survfit</code>.  Only a few have relevance to the evironmental
sciences.
</p>
<p>A very important option is ‘dist’ which specifies the distributional
model to use in the regression.  The default is ‘lognormal’.  
</p>
<p>Another important option is ‘conf.int’.  This is NOT an option to
<code>survreg</code> but is an added feature (due to some arcane details of
R it can't be documented above).  The ‘conf.int’ option specifies
the level for a two-sided confidence interval on the regression.
The default is 0.95.  This interval will be used in when the output
object is passed to other generic functions such as <code>mean</code>
and <code>quantile</code>.  See Examples below.
</p>
<p>Also supported is a ‘gaussian’ or a normal distribution.  The use of
a gaussian distribution requires an interval censoring context for
left-censored data.  Luckily, this routine automatically does this
for you – simply specify ‘gaussian’ and the correct manipulations
are done.
</p>
<p>If any other distribution is specified besides lognormal or gaussian, 
the return object is a raw survreg object – it is up to the user to
‘do the right thing’ with the output (and input for that matter).
</p>
<p>If you are using the formula interface:  The <code>censored</code> and
<code>groups</code> parameters are not specified – all information is provided
via a formula as the <code>obs</code> parameter.  The formula must have a
<code>Cen</code> object as the response on the left of the <code>~</code> operator and,
if desired, terms separated by + operators on the right.  
See Examples below.  
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a <code>cenmle</code> object.
Methods defined for <code>cenmle</code> objects are provided for
<code>mean</code>, <code>median</code>, <code>sd</code>.
