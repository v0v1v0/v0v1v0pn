<h2>
Compute regression equations and likelihood correlation coefficient
for censored data.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes regression equations for singly censored data using maximum
likelihood estimation. Estimates of slopes and intercept, tests
for significance of parameters,and predicted quantiles (Median =
points on the line) with confidence intervals can be computed.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">    cenreg(obs, censored, groups, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>obs</code></td>
<td>

<p>Either a numeric vector of observations or a formula.
See examples below.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>censored</code></td>
<td>

<p>If a formula is not specified, this should be
a logical vector indicating TRUE where an observation in obs is
censored (a less-than value) and FALSE otherwise.  
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>groups</code></td>
<td>

<p>If a formula is not specified, this should be a numeric
or factor vector that represents the explanatory variable.
</p>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>Additional items that are common to this function and the <code>survreg</code>
function from the ‘survival’ package.  The most important of which
is ‘dist’ and ‘conf.int’.  See Details below.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This routine is a front end to the <code>survreg</code> routine in the
<code>survival</code> package.  
</p>
<p>There are many additional options that are supported and documented
in <code>survfit</code>.  Only a few have relevance to the evironmental
sciences.
</p>
<p>A very important option is ‘dist’ which specifies the distributional
model to use in the regression.  The default is ‘lognormal’.  
</p>
<p>Another important option is ‘conf.int’.  This is NOT an option to
<code>survreg</code> but is an added feature (due to some arcane details of
R it can't be documented above).  The ‘conf.int’ option specifies
the level for a two-sided confidence interval on the regression.
The default is 0.95.  This interval will be used in when the output
object is passed to other generic functions such as <code>mean</code>
and <code>quantile</code>.  See Examples below.
</p>
<p>Also supported is a ‘gaussian’ or a normal distribution.  The use of
a gaussian distribution requires an interval censoring context for
left-censored data.  Luckily, this routine automatically does this
for you – simply specify ‘gaussian’ and the correct manipulations
are done.
</p>
<p>If any other distribution is specified besides lognormal or gaussian, 
the return object is a raw survreg object – it is up to the user to
‘do the right thing’ with the output (and input for that matter).
</p>
<p>If you are using the formula interface:  The <code>censored</code> and
<code>groups</code> parameters are not specified – all information is
provided via a formula as the <code>obs</code> parameter.  The formula
must have a <code>Cen</code> object as the response on the left of the
<code>~</code> operator and, if desired, terms separated by + operators
on the right. See examples below.
</p>
<p>The reported likelihood r correlation coefficient measures the linear
association between y (groups) and x (obs), based on the difference
in log likelihoods between the fitted model and the null model.
Slopes and intercepts are fit by maximum likelihood.  A lognormal
distribution is fit by default, with a normal distribution being an
option.  Estimates of predicted values on the line can be obtained
by specifying the values for all x variables at which y is to be
predicted.  Requesting the median (p=0.5) will provide estimates on
the line for a lognormal distribution.  Estimates of the mean are
also possible, as are estimates of other percentiles.  Equations for
confidence intervals follow those of Meeker and Escobar (1098).
