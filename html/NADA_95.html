<h2>Copper in ground water from of San Joaquin Valley, USA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Copper concentrations in ground water from the Alluvial Fan zone in
the San Joaquin Valley of California.  One observation was altered to
become a &lt;21, larger than all of the detected observations (the largest
detected observation is a 20).
</p>
<p>Objective is to calculate summary statistics when the largest observation
is censored.
</p>
<p>There are five detection limits, at 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 ug/L.
An additional artificial detection limit of 21 was added to illustrate
a point.  Used in Chapter 6 of the NADA book.
