<h2>Times an expression, with breakdown of time spent in each function
!DEPRECATED October 14, 2022!</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A wrapper for the proftools package Rprof() function.
It is to Rprof() as system.time() is to proc.time() (base)
Useful for identifying which functions are taking the
most time. This procedure will return an error unless
expr takes more than ~0.1 seconds to evaluate. I 
could not see any simple way to avoid this limitation. Occassionally
other errors are produced for no apparent reason which are due
to issues within the proftools package that are out of my
control.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">timeit(expr, suppressResult = F, total.time = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>expr</code></td>
<td>
<p>an expression, must take at least 1 second (roughly)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>suppressResult</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, if true, will return timing 
information rather than the result of expr</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>total.time</code></td>
<td>
<p>to sort by total.time, else by self.time</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>returns matrix where rows are function names, and columns
are self.time and total.time. total.time is total time spent 
in that function, including function calls made by that function.
self.time doesn't count other functions within a function
