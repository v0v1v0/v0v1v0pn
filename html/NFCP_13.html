<h2>Crude oil term structure futures data (1990 - 1995)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>SS_oil</code> <code>list</code> object features the approximate weekly observations of Crude Oil (WTI) futures contracts used to develop a two-factor
commodity pricing model within the prominent work of Schwartz and Smith (2000) titled: "Short-Term Variations and long-Term Dynamics in Commodity Prices".
The two-factor commodity pricing model presented within this study is also included. The <code>SS_oil</code> list object is used extensively within the
<code>NFCP</code> package to provide working examples and showcase the features of the package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(SS_oil)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>list</code> Containing eight objects:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>contracts</dt>
<dd>
<p>A data frame with 268 rows and 82 columns. Each column represents a Crude Oil futures contract, and each row represents a closing
weekly price for that futures contract. Observation dates of the contract object are weekly in frequency from
<code>1990-02-06</code> to <code>1995-02-14</code>. Contracts without observations on a particular date are represented as <code>NA</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>stitched_futures</dt>
<dd>
<p>Schwartz and Smith (2000) applied stitched contract observation data to estimate commodity pricing models, which
are approximated within this object. The <code>stitched_futures</code> object was developed using the <code>stitch_contracts</code> function (see <code>stitch_contracts</code> examples for more details). Contracts were
stitched according to the contract numbers
specified within the object <code>stitched_TTM</code>. <code>stitched_futures</code> is
identical to the futures data made available within the MATLAB program "SchwartzSmithModel" developed by Goodwin (2013).</p>
</dd>
<dt>spot</dt>
<dd>
<p>A <code>data.frame</code> of spot prices of Crude Oil. weekly in frequency from
<code>1990-02-06</code> to <code>1995-02-14</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>final_trading_days</dt>
<dd>
<p>Named vector listing the final trading days of each observed futures contract within the <code>contracts</code> object. Each element of
<code>final_trading_days</code> corresponds to a column of the <code>contracts</code> object. The final
trading day of a futures contract is used to calculate the number of business
days from a given observation to the maturity of the contract (ie. a contract time to maturity).</p>
</dd>
<dt>contract_maturities</dt>
<dd>
<p>A data frame with identical dimensions to the <code>contracts</code> data frame. This data frame
lists the time to maturity of a given futures contract in years at each observation point.
This is identical to the number of business days (in years) between the observed date and the final trading day of a particular futures contract.
The maturity matrix assumes 262 trading days a year. If the contract is not yet available or has expired, the <code>contract_maturities</code> element is <code>NA</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>stitched_TTM</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector corresponding to the constant time to maturities that was
assumed within the original study of Schwartz and Smith (2000).</p>
</dd>
<dt>dt</dt>
<dd>
<p>The discrete time step used to estimate parameters with this data. The time step is 5/262, which represents a
weekly frequency of observations where each weekday is a business day (ie. there are no business days on weekends).</p>
</dd>
<dt>two_factor</dt>
<dd>
<p>The crude oil two-factor commodity pricing model parameters presented within the work of Schwartz and Smith (2000).
These parameter estimates are prolific, benchmarked within several subsequent publications.</p>
</dd>
