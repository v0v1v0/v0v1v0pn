<h2>Sample NFL play-by-play data with a specified 4th down strategy</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function will return a sample play from the nflscrapR play-by-play
data for a given down, distance, yards from the team's goal, using
a given strategy on fourth down. The strategies are: empirical, always 
going for it on fourth down, never going for it on fourth down, go for it 
if one is less than a certain distance from a first down/touchdown,
and go for it if it maximizes one's expected points. This should be primarily
used within the 'NFLSimulatoR::sample_play()' function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sample_fourth_down_strategy(
  what_down,
  yards_to_go,
  yards_from_own_goal,
  window_yards_from_own_goal = 1,
  play_by_play_data,
  fourth_down_strategy = "empirical",
  yards_less_than = 5
)
