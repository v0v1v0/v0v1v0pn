<h2>Sample NFL play-by-play data with a specified blend of rushing and passing</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function will return a sample play from the nflscrapR play-by-play
data for a given down, distance, yards from the team's goal, using
a given pass/rush play strategy. The user may choose a value for the 
proportion of passing plays to be sampled. Thus one can test strategies
in which the team always passes, always runs, or some distribution of the two.
This strategy is only intended for downs 1 - 3, and uses an empirical strategy 
for fourth downs.
This should be primarily used within the 'NFLSimulatoR::sample_play()' function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sample_passes_rushes_strategy(
  what_down,
  yards_to_go,
  yards_from_own_goal,
  window_yards_from_own_goal = 1,
