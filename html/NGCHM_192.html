<h2>Initialization of the NGCHM library.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>When first loaded the NGCHM library reads configuration files in
the configuration path specified by the NGCHMCONFIGPATH environment variable.  The
configuration path is a colon (:) separated list of directory names.
If not set it defaults to /etc/ngchm:/usr/local/ngchm:/opt/ngchm:$HOME/.ngchm.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For each configuration directory in the configuration path, the NGCHM package
reads the contents of the configuration files in the conf.d subdirectory in order (as
determined by the R sort function).  Other subdirectories are not scanned
unless instructed to by an entry in a configuration file.
</p>
<p>Configuration files may be either text files (.txt extension), R scripts (.R extension),
or javascript files (.js extension).
</p>
<p>Here is an example directory structruce for a server named 'my_server':
</p>
<pre>
.
|-- conf.d
|   \-- 00-servers.txt
\-- my_server
    \-- config.txt
</pre>
<p>Here are the contents of an example 00-servers.txt file:
</p>
<pre>
[servers]
my-server = /usr/local/ngchm/my_server
</pre>
<p>Here are the contents of an example config.txt file:
</p>
<pre>
serverProtocol = shaidy
accessMethod = api
basePath = &lt;URL to server. e.g. "https://mydomain.edu/server/api"&gt;
serverURL = &lt;URL to server. e.g. "https://mydomain.edu/server"&gt;
</pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>None. This function is used for its side effects of loading configuration files.
</p>


<h3>Text files</h3>

<p>A text configuration file consists of one or more sections.  Each section begins with a
single line containing the section type enclosed in square brackets. Subsequent lines in
the section are either blank or contain a definition of the form "name separator value".
The default separator is the equals sign (=).
</p>
<p>The 'servers' section defines available servers.  The name field defines the name by which
the server is known to the library.  The value field specifies a directory containing
a specification of the server's properties.  The server specification directory must contain
a config.txt that contains lines of the form "name separator value".  The config.txt file
must define the value of 'serverProtocol' to be the name of a ngchmServerProtocol.  It
must also define the values of any mandatory parameters required by ngchmServerProtocol, and
may optionally define any optional parameters.
</p>


<h3>R scripts</h3>

<p>R scripts are sourced.  They can be used to define local NGCHM related functions.
</p>


<h3>Javascript scripts</h3>

<p>Javascript files define context specific menu entries.
