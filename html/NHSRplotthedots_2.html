<h2>Rebase</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Produces an object that can be used for rebasing an SPC chart. This method provides two different ways to rebase:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> You can either provide a single vector of dates, which will rebase every facet of an SPC with the same dates
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> You can provide named vectors of dates, where the names correspond to the names of the facets, in order to
rebase a facetted chart
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ptd_rebase(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>either a single vector of dates, or, named vectors of dates. See examples.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># if you aren't using a facetted chart, or you want to rebase each facet at the same dates, then
# you can simply call this method with a vector of dates. For example, to rebase on the 1^st^
# January 2020 and 22^nd^ March 2020:

ptd_rebase(as.Date(c("2020-01-01", "2020-03-22")))

# if you are using a facetted chart, and wish to rebase each facet with different dates, then
# you can call this method, naming each vector of dates with the name of the facet. If there are
# facet's that you don't need to rebase you can simply ignore them. For example, if you had a
# chart with facets "a", "b", and "c", and you wanted to rebase "a" on the 1^st^ January 2020,
# and "b" on the 22^nd^ March 2020:

ptd_rebase(
  "a" = as.Date("2020-01-01"),
  "b" = as.Date("2020-03-22")
)
