<h2>Target</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Produces an object that can be used for adding Targets to an SPC chart. This method provides two different ways to
add a target:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> You can either provide a single value, which will apply the same target to every facet of an SPC
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> You can provide named values of targets, where the names correspond to the names of the facets, in order to
have different targets for each facet
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ptd_target(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>either a single values, or, named values of targets. See examples.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is a helper to provide data in the correct format for use with <code>ptd_spc()</code>. See <strong>Value</strong>
section for details of return type. If you are trying to do something like <code>ptd_spc(list_of_values)</code> then you can
skip using the function and just use <code>list_of_values</code>, so long as the list meets the requirements as listed above.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>returns either:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> a single numeric value, in this case all facets in the plot will use this target value
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> a named list of single numeric values, where each item is named as for one of the facet's in the plot. If a facet
isn't specified then it will not have a target
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># if you aren't using a facetted chart, or you want to use the same target for each facet, you
# can simply call this method with a single value. For example, to use a target of 90%:

ptd_target(0.9)

# if you are using a facetted chart, and wish to use a different target for each facet, then you
# can call this method, naming each value with the name of the facet. Any facet that isn't listed
# will not have a target applied to it.

# For example, to apply a target of 25 to the "a" facet and 10 to the "b" facet:

ptd_target(
  "a" = 25,
  "b" = 10
)

# If you already have your data in a list, you do not need to use ptd_target(). But, if you
# wanted to check that your values are valid, you could call it like so:

my_targets &lt;- list("a" = 25, "b" = 10)
do.call(ptd_target, my_targets)

# or, if your targets are in a numeric vector
my_targets &lt;- c("a" = 25, "b" = 10)
do.call(ptd_target, as.list(my_targets))
