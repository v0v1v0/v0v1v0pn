<h2>Plot(s) to monitor selected outlier and influential measure(s).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates plot(s) of the selected outlier detection
measure(s) for each study included in the network. Candidate
statistics to be monitored are: Standardized residual; Studentized
residual; Mahalanobis distance and leverage.
</p>
<p>The function also generates plot(s) of the selected outlier
detection measure(s) considering a deletion of each study included
in the network (Shift the mean measures).  Candidate statistics to
be monitored are: Standardized deleted residual; Studentized
deleted residual; Cook distance between the treatment estimates for
study j and treatment estimates when study j is removed; Ratio of
determinants of variance-covariance matrix of treatment estimates
for study j to treatment estimates when study j is removed; weight
leave one out;leverage leave one out; heterogeneity estimator leave
one out; R statistic for heterogeneity; R statistic for Q
(<code>Qtotal</code>), R statistic for heterogeneity Q (<code>Qhet</code>), R
statistic for Qinconsistency (<code>Qinc</code>), DFbetas.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">measplot(object, stat, measure = "simple")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class NMAoutlier.measures (mandatory).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stat</code></td>
<td>
<p>selected statistical outlier and influential detection
measure (mandatory), For simply outlier and influential measures
available choices are: ("estand"/ "estud"/ "mah"/ "leverage").
For outlier and influential deletion measures available choices
are: ("estand.deleted", "estud.deleted", "leverage.leaveoneout",
"weight.leaveoneout", "heterog.leaveoneout", "covratio", "cook",
"rheterogeneity", "restimates", "rqhet", "rqinc", "rqtotal",
"dfbetas")</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>measure</code></td>
<td>
<p>Outlier and influential detection measures. Simple
measures (default: "simple") and measures considered study
deletion (measure = "deletion").</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Plot of outlier and influential (simple or/and deletion) detection
measures for each study included in the network.  Vertical axis
provides each study included in the network (or the study deleted
for outlier deletion measures). Horizontal axis provides a
monitoring outlier and influential detection measure.
