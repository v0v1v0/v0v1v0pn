<h2>NMVANOVA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The 'NRMANOVA' (Novice Repeated Measures ANOVA) is a streamlined function that allows novice 'Rstudio' users to perform repeated measures one-way analysis of variance without downloading  multiple libraries or packages. Users can easily manipulate the data block, n-value, k-value, and factor to optimize analysis for any data set.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
RManovaNov(r,k,f,n)

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>r</code></td>
<td>

<p>The dataset or source you want to examine
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>

<p>The number of replications in the experiment or analysis need to perform
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>f</code></td>
<td>

<p>The factor,subject, and/or category that is being examined.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function has a built in model were we create the treatment response with also including the blocking of the data(reponse~treatment+blocking). Also gives you diagnostics residual plots, and a TUKEY HSD so you can go past the anova table.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Anova analysis of the model with a TukeyHSD with diagnostic plots
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>More Packages to come to accommadate all models and designs in library called Novice ANOVA.
</p>
<p>Also, k is number of a set of factor like a measure of time. N is the sample size while usually you can directly input your data from excel or the data source of your choosing. F which is the factor can also be inputted from the data source.
