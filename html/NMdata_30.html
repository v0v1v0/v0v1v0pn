<h2>Merge, order, and check resulting rows and columns.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Stop checking that the number of rows is unchanged after a merge -
mergeCheck checks what you really want - i.e. x is extended with
columns from y while all rows in x are retained, and no new rows
are created (plus some more checks). mergeCheck is not a merge implementation - it is a
useful merge wrapper. The advantage over using much more flexible
merge or join function lies in the fully automated checking that
the results are consistent with the simple merge described above.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mergeCheck(
  x,
  y,
  by,
  by.x,
  by.y,
  common.cols = base::warning,
  ncols.expect,
  track.msg = FALSE,
  quiet,
  df1,
  df2,
  subset.x,
  fun.na.by = base::stop,
  as.fun,
  fun.commoncols,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data.frame with the number of rows must should be
obtained from the merge. The resulting data.frame will be
ordered like x.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data.frame that will be merged onto x.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by</code></td>
<td>
<p>The column(s) to merge by. Character string (vector). by
or by.x and by.y must be supplied.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by.x</code></td>
<td>
<p>If the columns to merge by in x and y are named
differently. by or by.x and by.y must be supplied.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by.y</code></td>
<td>
<p>If the columns to merge by in x and y are named
differently. by or by.x and by.y must be supplied.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>common.cols</code></td>
<td>
<p>If common columns are found in x and y, and
they are not used in 'by', this will by default create columns
named like col.x and col.y in result (see ?merge). Often, this
is a mistake, and the default is to throw a warning if this
happens. If using mergeCheck in programming, you may want to
make sure this is not happening and use
common.cols=stop. If you want nothing to happen, you can do
common.cols=NULL. You can also use 'common.cols="drop.x"'
to drop "non-by" columns in 'x' with identical column names in
'y'. Use "drop.y" to drop them in 'y' and avoid the
conflicts. The last option is to use 'common.cols="merge.by"'
which means 'by' will automatically be extended to include all
common column names.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ncols.expect</code></td>
<td>
<p>If you want to include a check of the number
of columns being added to the dimensions of x. So if
ncols.expect=1, the resulting data must have exactly one
column more than x - if not, an error will be returned.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>track.msg</code></td>
<td>
<p>If using mergeCheck inside other functions, it
can be useful to use track.msg=TRUE. This will add information
to messages/warnings/errors that they came from mergCheck.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quiet</code></td>
<td>
<p>If FALSE, the names of the added columns are
reported. Default value controlled by NMdataConf.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df1</code></td>
<td>
<p>Deprecated. Use x.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df2</code></td>
<td>
<p>Deprecated. Use y.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subset.x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Not implemented.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fun.na.by</code></td>
<td>
<p>If NA's are found in (matched) by columns in both
x and why, what should we do? This could be OK, but in many
cases, it's because something unexpected is happening. Use
fun.na.by=NULL if you don't want to be notified and want to go
ahead regardless.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>as.fun</code></td>
<td>
<p>The default is to return a data.table if x is a
data.table and return a data.frame in all other cases. Pass a
function in as.fun to convert to something else.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fun.commoncols</code></td>
<td>
<p>Deprecated. Please use 'common.cols'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>additional arguments passed to data.table::merge. If
all is among them, an error will be returned.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Besides merging and checking rows, mergeCheck makes sure
the order in x is retained in the resulting data (both rows
and column order). Also, a warning is given if column names
are overlapping, making merge create new column names like
col.x and col.y. Merges and other operations are done using
data.table. If x is a data.frame (and not a data.table), it
will internally be converted to a data.table, and the
resulting data.table will be converted back to a data.frame
before returning.
</p>
<p>mergeCheck is for the kind of merges where we think of x
as the data to be enriched with columns from y - rows
unchanged. This is even further limited than a left join where
you can match rows multiple times. A common example of the use
of mergeCheck is for adding covariates to a pk/pd data set. We
do not want that to remove or duplicate doses, observations,
or simulation records. In those cases, mergeCheck does all
needed checks, and you can run full speed without checking
dimensions (which is anyway not exactly the right thing to do
in the general case) or worry that something might go wrong.
</p>
<p>Checks performed:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> x has &gt;0 rows
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> by columns are present in x an y
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Merge is not performed on NA values. If by=ID and both x$ID and
y$ID contain NA's, an error is thrown (see argument fun.na.by).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Merge is done by all common column names in x and y. A
warning is thrown if there are column names that are not being
used to merge by. This will result in two columns named like BW.x
and BW.y and is often unintended.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Before merging a row counter is added to x. After the merge, the
result is assured to have exactly one occurrence of each of the
values of the row counter in x.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, row and column order from x is retained in the result.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> df1 &lt;- data.frame(x = 1:10,
                   y=letters[1:10],
                   stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
 df2 &lt;- data.frame(y=letters[1:11],
                   x2 = 1:11,
                   stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

 mc1 &lt;- mergeCheck(x=df1,y=df2,by="y")

## Notice as opposed to most merge/join algorithms, mergeCheck by
#default retains both row and column order from x
library(data.table)
merge(as.data.table(df1),as.data.table(df2))
## Here we get a duplicate of a df1 row in the result. If we only
## check dimensions, we make a mistake. mergeCheck captures the
## error - and tell us where to find the problem (ID 31 and 180):
## Not run: 
pk &lt;- readRDS(file=system.file("examples/data/xgxr2.rds",package="NMdata"))
dt.cov &lt;- pk[,.(ID=unique(ID))]
dt.cov[,COV:=sample(1:5,size=.N,replace=TRUE)]
dt.cov &lt;- dt.cov[c(1,1:(.N-1))]
dim(pk)
res.merge &lt;- merge(pk,dt.cov,by="ID")
dim(res.merge)
mergeCheck(pk,dt.cov,by="ID")
