<h2>Read simulation results based on NMsim's track of model runs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Read simulation results based on NMsim's track of model runs
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">NMreadSim(
  x,
  check.time = FALSE,
  dir.sims,
  wait = FALSE,
  quiet = FALSE,
  progress,
  as.fun
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Path to the simulation-specific rds file generated by
NMsim, typically called 'NMsim_MetaData.rds'. Can also be a table
of simulation runs as stored in 'rds' files by 'NMsim'. The
latter should almost never be used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>check.time</code></td>
<td>
<p>If found, check whether 'fst' file modification
time is newer than 'rds' file. The 'fst' is generated based on
information in ‘rds', but notice that some systems don’t
preserve the file modification times. Becasue of that,
'check.time' is 'FALSE' by default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dir.sims</code></td>
<td>
<p>By default, 'NMreadSim' will use information about
the relative path from the results table file ('_MetaData.rds')
to the Nonmem simulation results. If these paths have changed,
or for other reasons this doesn't work, you can use the
'dir.sims' argument to specify where to find the Nonmem
simulation results. If an '.fst' file was already generated
and is found next to the '_MetaData.rds', the path to the Nonmem
simulation results is not used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>wait</code></td>
<td>
<p>If simulations seem to not be done yet, wait for them
to finish? If not, an error will be thrown. If you choose to
wait, the risk is results never come. 'NMreadSim' will be
waiting for an 'lst' file. If Nonmem fails, it will normally
generate an 'lst' file. But if 'NMTRAN' fails (checks of
control stream prior to running Nonmem), the 'lst' file is not
generated.  Default is not to wait.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quiet</code></td>
<td>
<p>Turn off some messages about what is going on?
Default is to report the messages.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>progress</code></td>
<td>
<p>Track progress? Default is 'TRUE' if 'quiet' is
FALSE and more than one model is being read. The progress
tracking is based on the number of models completed/read, not
the status of the individual models.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>as.fun</code></td>
<td>
<p>The default is to return data as a data.frame. Pass
a function (say 'tibble::as_tibble') in as.fun to convert to
something else. If data.tables are wanted, use
as.fun="data.table". The default can be configured using
NMdataConf.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data set of class defined by as.fun
