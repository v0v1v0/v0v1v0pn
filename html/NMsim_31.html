<h2>Simulate from an estimated Nonmem model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Supply a data set and an estimation input control stream, and
NMsim can create neccesary files (control stream, data files), run
the simulation and read the results. It has additional methods for
other simulation types available, can do multiple simulations at
once and more. Please see vignettes for an introduction to how to
get the most out of this.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file.mod</code></td>
<td>
<p>Path(s) to the input control stream(s) to run the
simulation on. The output control stream is for now assumed to
be stored next to the input control stream and ending in .lst
instead of .mod. The .ext file must also be present. If
simulating known subjects, the .phi is necessary too.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>The simulation data as a <code>data.frame</code> or a list
of <code>data.frame</code>s. If a list, the model(s) will be run on
each of the data sets in the list.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dir.sims</code></td>
<td>
<p>The directory in which NMsim will store all
generated files. Default is to create a folder called 'NMsim'
next to 'file.mod'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name.sim</code></td>
<td>
<p>Give all filenames related to the simulation a
suffix. A short string describing the sim is recommended like
"ph3_regimens".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>order.columns</code></td>
<td>
<p>reorder columns by calling
<code>NMdata::NMorderColumns</code> before saving dataset and
running simulations? Default is TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file.ext</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optionally provide a parameter estimate file from
Nonmem. This is normally not needed since 'NMsim' will by
default use the ext file stored next to the input control
stream (replacing the file name extension with '.ext'). If
using method.update.inits="psn", this argument cannot be
used. If you want provide parameters to be used for the
simulation, look at the 'ext' argument to 'NMsim_VarCov'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>script</code></td>
<td>
<p>The path to the script where this is run. For
stamping of dataset so results can be traced back to code.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subproblems</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of subproblems to use as
<code>SUBPROBLEMS</code> in <code>$SIMULATION</code> block in Nonmem. The
default is subproblem=0 which means not to use
<code>SUBPROBLEMS</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reuse.results</code></td>
<td>
<p>If simulation results found on file, should
they be used? If TRUE and reading the results fail, the
simulations will still be rerun.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seed.R</code></td>
<td>
<p>A value passed to <code>set.seed()</code>. It may be
better use <code>seed.R</code> rather than calling <code>set.seed()</code>
manually because the seed can then be captured and stored by
<code>NMsim()</code> for reproducibility. See <code>seed.nm</code> for
finer control of the seeds that are used in the Nonmem control
streams.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seed.nm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Control Nonmem seeds. If a numeric, a vector or a
'data.frame', these are used as the the seed values (a single
value or vector will be recycled so make sure the dimesnsions
are right, the number of columns in a <code>data.frame</code> will
dictate the number of seeds in each Nonmem control stream. Use
a list with elements 'values', and 'dist' and others for
detailed control of the random sources. See <code>?NMseed</code> for
details on what arguments can be passed this way.
</p>
<p>Default is to draw seeds betwen
0 and 2147483647 (the values supported by Nonmem) for each
simulation. You can pass a function that will be evaluated
(say to choose a different pool of seeds to draw from).
</p>
<p>To avoid changing an exisiting seed in a control stream, use
<code>seed.nm="asis"</code>.
</p>
<p>In case <code>method.sim=NMsim_EBE</code>, seeds are not used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>args.psn.execute</code></td>
<td>
<p>A charachter string that will be passed as
arguments PSN's 'execute'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>table.vars</code></td>
<td>
<p>Variables to be printed in output table as a
character vector or a space-separated string of variable
names. The default is to export the same tables as listed in
the input control stream. If <code>table.vars</code> is provided,
all output tables in estimation control streams are dropped
and replaced by a new one with just the provided variables. If
many variables are exported, and much fewer are used, it can
speed up NMsim significantly to only export what is needed
(sometimes this is as little as "PRED IPRED"). Nonmem writes
data slowly so reducing output data can make a big difference
in execution time. See <code>table.options</code> too.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>table.options</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector or a string of
space-separated options. Only used if <code>table.vars</code> is
provided. If constructing a new output table with
<code>table.vars</code> the default is to add two options,
<code>NOAPPEND</code> and <code>NOPRINT</code>. You can modeify that with
<code>table.options</code>. Do not try to modify output filename -
<code>NMsim</code> takes care of that.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>text.sim</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string to be pasted into
$SIMULATION. This must not contain seed or SUBPROBLEM which
are handled separately. Default is to include "ONLYSIM". To
avoid that, use text.sim="".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method.sim</code></td>
<td>
<p>A function (not quoted) that creates the
simulation control stream and other necessary files for a
simulation based on the estimation control stream, the data,
etc. The default is called <code>NMsim_default</code> which will
replace any estimation and covariance step by a simulation
step. See details section on oter methods, and see examples
and especially vignettes on how to use the different provided
methods.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>typical</code></td>
<td>
<p>Run with all ETAs fixed to zero? Technically all ETAs=0 is obtained by replacing
<code>$OMEGA</code> by a zero matrix. Default is FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>execute</code></td>
<td>
<p>Execute the simulation or only prepare it?
'execute=FALSE' can be useful if you want to do additional
tweaks or simulate using other parameter estimates.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sge</code></td>
<td>
<p>Submit to cluster? Default is not to, but this is very
useful if creating a large number of simulations,
e.g. simulate with all parameter estimates from a bootstrap
result.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nc</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of cores used in parallelization. This is so far
only supported with <code>method.execute="psn"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>transform</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list defining transformations to be applied
after the Nonmem simulations and before plotting. For each
list element, its name refers to the name of the column to
transform, the contents must be the function to apply.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method.execute</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specify how to call Nonmem. Options are
"psn" (PSN's execute), "nmsim" (an internal method similar to
PSN's execute), and "direct" (just run Nonmem directly and
dump all the temporary files). "nmsim" has advantages over
"psn" that makes it the only supported method when
type.sim="NMsim_EBE". "psn" has the simple advantage that
the path to nonmem does not have to be specified if "execute"
is in the system search path. So as long as you know where
your Nonmem executable is, "nmsim" is recommended. The default
is "nmsim" if path.nonmem is specified, and "psn" if not.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method.update.inits</code></td>
<td>
<p>The initial values of all parameters
are by updated from the estimated model before running the
simulation. NMsim can do this with a native function or use
PSN to do it - or the step can be skipped to not update the
values. The possible values are
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>"psn"
uses PSN's "update_inits". Requires a functioning PSN
installation and possibly that <code>dir.psn</code> is correctly
set. The advantages of this method are that it keeps comments
in the control stream and that it is a method known to many.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"nmsim"
Uses a simple internal method to update the parameter values
based on the ext file.  The advantages of "nmsim" are it does not
require PSN, and that it does not rely on code-interpretation for generation of simulation control streams. "nmsim" fixes the whole
OMEGA and SIGMA matrices as single blocks making the $OMEGA and
$SIGMA sections of the control streams less easy to read. On the
other hand, this method is robust because it avoids any
interpretation of BLOCK structure or other code in the control
streams.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"none" Do nothing. This is useful if the model to simulate
has not been estimated but parameter values have been manually put
into the respective sections in the control stream.
</p>
<p>On linux/mac, The default is to use "PSN" if found. On Windows, "nmsim"
is the default.

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dir.psn</code></td>
<td>
<p>The directory in which to find PSN's executables
('execute' and 'update_inits'). The default is to rely on the
system's search path. So if you can run 'execute' and
'update_inits' by just typing that in a terminal, you don't
need to specify this unless you want to explicitly use a
specific installation of PSN on your system.</p>

<p>Named list of additional control stream
section edits. Note, these can be functions that define how to
edit sections. This is an advanced feature which is not needed
to run most simulations. It is however powerful for some types
of analyses, like modifying parameter values. See vignettes
for further information.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sim.dir.from.scratch</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE (default) this will wipe the
simulation directory before running new simulations. The
directory that will be emptied is _not_ dir.sims where you may
keep many or all your simulations. It is the subdirectory
named based on the run name and <code>name.sim</code>. The reason it
is advised to wipe this directory is that if you in a previous
simulation created simulation runs that are now obsolete, you
could end up reading those too when collecting the
results. NMsim will delete previously generated simulation
control streams with the same name, but this option goes
further. An example where it is important is if you first ran
1000 replications, fixed something and now rand 500. If you
choose FALSE here, you can end up with the results of 500 new
and 500 old simulations.</p>

this argument to pass additional arguments (in a list) to that
function if you want the results to be read in a specific
way. This can be if the model for some reason drops rows, and
you need to merge by a row identifier. You would do
'args.NMscanData=list(col.row="ROW")' to merge by a column
called 'ROW'. This is only used in rare cases.</p>

<td>
<p>Provide a path to a directory in which to save rds
files with paths to results. Default is to use dir.sims. After
running 'NMreadSim()' on these files, the original simulation
files can be deleted. Hence, providing both 'dir.sims' and
'dir.res' provides a structure that is simple to
clean. 'dir.sims' can be purged when 'NMreadSim' has been run
and only small 'rds' and 'fst' files will be kept in
'dir.res'. Notice, in case multiple models are simulated,
multiple 'rds' (to be read with 'NMreadSim()') files will be
created by default. In cases where multiple models are
simulated, see 'file.res' to get just one file refering to all
simulation results.</p>

'NMsim_..._MetaData.rds' under the <code>dir.res</code> directory
where ... is based on the model name. However, if multiple
models (<code>file.mod</code>) are simulated, this will result in
multiple rds files. Specifying a path ensures that one rds

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Loosely speaking, the argument <code>method.sim</code> defines
_what_ NMsim will do, <code>method.execute</code> define _how_ it
does it. <code>method.sim</code> takes a function that converts an
estimation control stream into whatever should be
run. Features like replacing '$INPUT', '$DATA', '$TABLE', and
handling seeds are NMsim features that are done in addition to
the <code>method.sim</code>. Also the <code>modeify.model</code> argument
is handled in addition to the <code>method.sim</code>. The
<code>subproblems</code> and <code>seed</code> arguments are available to
all methods creating a <code>$SIMULATION</code> section.
</p>
<p>Notice, the following functions are internally available to
'NMsim' so you can run them by say <code>method.sim=NMsim_EBE</code>
without quotes. To see the code of that method, type
<code>NMsim_EBE</code>.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>NMsim_default</code> The default behaviour. Replaces any
$ESTIMATION and $COVARIANCE sections by a $SIMULATION section.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>NMsim_asis</code> The simplest of all method. It does nothing (but
again, <code>NMsim</code> handles '$INPUT', '$DATA', '$TABLE' and
more. Use this for instance if you already created a simulation
(or estimation actually) control stream and want NMsim to run it
on different data sets.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>NMsim_typical</code> Deprecated. Use <code>typical=TRUE</code> instead. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>NMsim_EBE</code> Simulates _known_ ETAs. By default, the ETA
values are automatically taken from the estimation run. This is
what is refered to as emperical Bayes estimates, hence the name of
the method "NMsim_EBE". However, the user can also provide a
different '.phi' file which may contain simulated ETA values (see
the 'file.phi' argument). ID values in the simulation data set
must match ID values in the phi file for this step to work. If
refering to estimated subjects, the .phi file from the estimation
run must be found next to the .lst file from the estimation with
the same file name stem (say 'run1.lst' and 'run1.phi'). Again, ID
values in the (simulation) input data must be ID values that were
used in the estimation too. The method Runs an <code>$ESTIMATION
MAXEVAL=0</code> but pulls in ETAs for the ID's found in data. No
<code>$SIMULATION</code> step is run which unfortunately means no
residual error will be simulated.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>NMsim_VarCov</code> Like <code>NMsim_default</code> but '$THETA',
'$OMEGA', and 'SIGMA' are drawn from distribution estimated in
covariance step. This means that a successful covariance step must
be available from the estimation. NB. A multivariate normal
distribution is used for all parameters, including '$OMEGA' and
'$SIGMA' which is not the correct way to do this. In case the
simulation leads to negative diagonal elements in $OMEGA and
$SIGMA, those values are truncated at zero. This method is only
valid for simulation of '$THETA' variability. The method accepts a
table of parameter values that can be produced with other tools
than 'NMsim'. For simulation with parameter variability based on
bootstrap results, use <code>NMsim_default</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.frame with simulation results (same number of rows
as input data). If 'sge=TRUE' a character vector with paths to
simulation control streams.
