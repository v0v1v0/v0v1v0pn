<h2>NO.PING.PONG</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains two functions, NO.PING.PONG and PLOT_NO.PING.PONG, 
for revealing what happens when effect size estimates from previous studies 
are taken into account when evaluating each new dataset in a study sequence. 
The analyses can be conducted for cumulative meta-analyses and for 
Bayesian data analyses. The findings from these methods can be contrasted with
those from null hypothesis statistical sigificance testing, which does
not take previous findings into account.
</p>
<p>The package contains sample data for a wide selection 
of research topics that can be used to illustrate why previous findings 
should be taken into account when attempting to reach a conclusion about an 
effect when evaluating a new dataset. Jointly considering previous findings 
along with new data is more likely to result in correct conclusions than does 
the traditional practice of not incorporating previous findings and which often
results in a back and forth ping-pong of conclusions when evaluating
a sequence of studies.
