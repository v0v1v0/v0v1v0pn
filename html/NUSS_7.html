<h2>Segmenting sequences with unigrams</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>unigram_sequence_segmentation</code> segments input sequence into possible segmented
text based on unigram sequence segmentation approach.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">unigram_sequence_segmentation(
  sequences,
  unigram_dictionary = NUSS::base_dictionary,
  retrieve = "most-scored",
  simplify = TRUE,
  omit_zero = TRUE,
  score_formula = "points / words.number ^ 2"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sequences</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector, sequence to be segmented
(e.g., hashtag). Case-sensitive.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>unigram_dictionary</code></td>
<td>
<p>data.frame, containing ids, words to search, words to use
for segmentation, and their points. See details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>retrieve</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of length 1, the type of the result
data.frame to be returned: 'all', 'first-shortest', 'most-pointed' or
'most-scored'. See value section.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>simplify</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, if adjacent numbers should be merged into one,
and underscores removed. See simplification section.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>omit_zero</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, if words with 0 points should be omitted
from word count. See simplification section.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>score_formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of length 1, with formula
to calculate score.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is not intended for long strings segmentation -
70 characters should be considered too long
and may take hours to complete. 15 characters takes about 0.02s,
30 characters about 0.03s.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The output always will be data.frame. If <code>retrieve='all'</code>
is used, then the return will include all possible segmentation
of the given sequence.<br>
If <code>retrieve='first-shortest'</code> is used, the first of the shortest
segmentations (with respect to the order of word's appearance
in the dictionary, 1 row).<br>
If <code>retrieve='most-pointed'</code> is used, segmentation with most total
points is returned (1 row).<br>
If <code>retrieve='most-scored'</code> is used, segmentation with the highest
score calculated as
<br><code class="reqn">score = points / words.number ^ 2</code> (or as specified by the user).
<br><strong>The output is not in the input order. If needed, use
lapply</strong>
</p>


<h3>unigram_dictionary</h3>

<p>Dictionary has to be data.frame with four named columns: 1) to_search,
2) to_replace, 3) id, 4) points.<br>
'to_search' should be column of type character, containing unigram to
look for. Word case might be used.<br>
'to_replace' should be column of type character, containing word that
should be used for creating segmentation vector, if 'to_search' matches
text. <br>
'id' should be column of type numeric, containing id of unigram.<br>
'points' should be column of type numeric, containing number of points
for the word - the higher, the better. Unigrams with 0 points might be
removed from the word count with omit_zero argument.
</p>


<h3>Simplification</h3>

<p>Two arguments are possible for simplification:<br></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> simplify - removes spaces between numbers and removes underscores,<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p> omit_zero - removes ids of 0-pointed unigrams,
and omits them in the word count.<br>
By default segmented sequence will be simplified,
and numbers and underscores will be removed from word count
for score computing, since they are neutral as they are necessary.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># With custom dictionary
texts &lt;- c("this is science",
           "science is #fascinatingthing",
           "this is a scientific approach",
           "science is everywhere",
           "the beauty of science")
udict &lt;- unigram_dictionary(texts)
unigram_sequence_segmentation('thisisscience', udict)

# With built-in dictionary (English, only lowercase)
