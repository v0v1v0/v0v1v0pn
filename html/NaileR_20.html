<h2>Interpret a group based on answers to open-ended questions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generate an LLM response to analyze a categorical latent variable, based on answers to open-ended questions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">nail_textual(
  dataset,
  num.var,
  num.text,
  introduction = "",
  request = NULL,
  model = "llama3",
  isolate.groups = TRUE,
  generate = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dataset</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame made up of at least one categorical variable and a textual variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>num.var</code></td>
<td>
<p>the index of the categorical variable to be characterized.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>num.text</code></td>
<td>
<p>the index of the textual variable that characterizes the categorical variable of interest.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>introduction</code></td>
<td>
<p>the introduction for the LLM prompt.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>request</code></td>
<td>
<p>the request made to the LLM.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>the model name ('llama3' by default).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>isolate.groups</code></td>
<td>
<p>a boolean that indicates whether to give the LLM a single prompt, or one prompt per category. Recommended with long catdes results.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>generate</code></td>
<td>
<p>a boolean that indicates whether to generate the LLM response. If FALSE, the function only returns the prompt.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function directly sends a prompt to an LLM. Therefore, to get a consistent answer, we highly recommend to customize the parameters introduction and request and add all relevant information on your data for the LLM. We also recommend renaming the columns with clear, unshortened and unambiguous names.
</p>
<p>Additionally, if isolate.groups = TRUE, you will need an introduction and a request that take into account the fact that only one group is analyzed at a time.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame, or a list of data frames, containing the LLM's prompt and response (if generate = TRUE).
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# Processing time is often longer than ten seconds
