<h2>AnimalSounds: Animal Sounds for Bioacustic Analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>NatureSounds is a package containing a collection of example animal sounds for bioacoustic analysis. 
The main goal is to provide example recordings to faciliate the development of bioacoustic 
tools in the R environment.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Most data sets are provided as extended selection tables. These are R objects that contains both the annotations (locations of signals in time and frequency) and the corresponding acoustic data as wave objects. Therefore, these are **self-contained objects** since the original sound files are no longer needed to perform acoustic analyses. These objects are created by the 'selection_table()' function from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR">warbleR</a>. Take a look at the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR/vignettes/Intro_to_warbleR.html">intro to warbleR vignette</a> for more details. Check out the packages <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR">warbleR</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=tuneR">tuneR</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=seewave">seewave</a> for sound file manipulation and analysis in R.
