<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Reducing confounding bias in observational studies of vaccine efficacy using negative control outcomes
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">negativeControlOutcomeAdjustment(Y1, Y2, Trt, W=NULL, 
          method=c("Joint-MH", "Joint-NC", "SS-Joint"), minObsPerStrata=20)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Y1</code></td>
<td>
<p>Binary vector for the outcome of interest.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Y2</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector of natural numbers for the secondary outcome, which should be unaffected by the treatment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Trt</code></td>
<td>
<p>Binary vector for the treatment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>W</code></td>
<td>
<p>Categorical confounders to define strata. <code>W</code> can be a factor, vector, matrix or data frame.
If <code>NULL</code>, then only the <code>Joint-NC</code> method will be used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Any of <code>"Joint-MH"</code>, <code>"Joint-NC"</code>, or <code>"SS-Joint"</code>. See details.
The default is all three methods.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>minObsPerStrata</code></td>
<td>
<p>Minimum number of observations within each stratum for the <code>SS-Joint</code> method. 
Strata with fewer than <code>minObsPerStrata</code> observations will be
removed from the <code>SS-Joint</code> calculation.
If no stratum has at least <code>minObsPerStrata</code> observations, 
then the <code>SS-Joint</code> method will not be used.
The default is 20.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Observations with missing or non-finite values will be removed from the data. <br>
For the <code>SS-Joint</code> method, strata that yield non-finite estimates
are removed from the calculations, and strata that contain 
too few observations as defined by <code>minObsPerStrata</code> above are removed. <br></p>
<p><b>Joint-MH</b> 
</p>
<p><code>Joint-MH</code> reduces bias due to unmeasured confounders in the estimate of the primary
outcome relative risk, by using the treatment effect on the secondary outcome. 
<code> Joint-MH</code> first estimates jointly the effects of the treatment on the primary and 
secondary outcomes from stratification (with Mantel-Haenszel-type weights) on the measured confounders, 
and then uses the non-zero estimated effect on the secondary outcome to "subtract off" bias due to 
unmeasured confounders. If the observed confounder used to stratify only has a few large strata, 
method <code>SS-Joint</code> could be used instead. 
If information on observed confounders is not provided, method <code>Joint-NC</code> is used instead.
</p>
<p><b>Joint-NC</b>
</p>
<p><code>Joint-NC</code> reduces bias due to unmeasured confounders in the estimate of the primary outcome
log-relative risk, by using the treatment effect on the secondary outcome. <code>Joint-NC</code> first estimates
jointly the effects of the treatment on the primary and secondary outcomes, by using log-links, 
and then uses the non-zero estimated effect on the secondary outcome to "subtract off" bias due
to unmeasured confounders. Information on potential observed confounders is not used with this method.
</p>
<p><b>SS-Joint</b>
</p>
<p><code>SS-Joint</code> applies method <code>Joint-NC</code> within each stratum of the observed confounders, 
in order to reduce bias due to unmeasured confounders in the primary outcome log-relative risk estimate. 
More precisely, it estimates jointly the effects of the treatment on the primary and secondary outcomes, 
by using log-links, within each stratum. 
It then "subtracts off" the non-zero estimated effects on the secondary outcome from the estimated effects 
on the primary outcome, respectively in each stratum. 
<code>SS-Joint</code> finally combines efficiently these stratum-specific estimates by taking a weighted combination, 
with weights inversely proportional to their respective variances. 
If no information on observed confounders is provided, method <code>Joint-NC</code> is used instead. 
If data is available on a categorical confounder, but with many possibly sparse strata, 
we recommend using method <code>Joint-MH</code> instead.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with columns <code>method</code>, <code>beta_1.hat</code>, <code>sd.beta_1.hat</code>, <code>n.strata</code> and
<code>error.message</code>, where <code>beta_1.hat</code> is the "de-biased" estimate of the 
treatment effect on <code>Y1</code>, 
<code>sd.beta_1.hat</code> is the sandwich estimate for the standard deviation of <code>beta_1.hat</code>,
and <code>n.strata</code> is the number of strata used in the calculation.
