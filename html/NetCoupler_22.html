<h2>Estimate the undirected graph of the metabolic data.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses the PC-algorithm and is mostly a wrapper around <code>pcalg::skeleton()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pc_estimate_undirected_graph(data, alpha = 0.01)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Input numeric data that forms the basis of the underlying graph.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>Significance level threshold applied to each test to determine
conditional dependence for if an edge exists.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function estimates the "skeleton of a DAG", meaning a graph without
arrowheads, aka an undirected graph.
The default estimation method used is the "PC-stable" method, which estimates
the <em>order-independent</em> skeleton of the DAG, meaning the order of the
variables given does not impact the results (older versions of the algorithm
were order-dependent). The method also assumes no latent variables.
</p>
<p>An edge is determined by testing for conditional dependence between two
nodes based on the <code>pcalg::gaussCItest()</code>. Conditional <em>independence</em> exists
when the nodes have zero partial correlation determined from a p-value based
hypothesis test against the correlation matrix of the data from the nodes.
The estimated edges exists between the <em>start</em> and <em>end</em> nodes when the
<em>start</em> and <em>end</em> variables are conditionally dependent given the subset of
remaining variables.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>pcAlgo</code> object that contains the DAG skeleton, aka undirected graph.
