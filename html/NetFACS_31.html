<h2>Calculate reciprocity of probabilities that two elements appear together</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For all dyadic combinations that ever appear, this function calculates how
reciprocal the conditional probabilities (i.e. probability of A given B, and
B given A) of the two elements are. Combinations that are highly reciprocal
indicate that the two elements always occur together and might represent a
fixed combination, while low reciprocity might indicate that one element is
an extension of the other. Values approaching -1 indicate that one element is
strongly dependent on the other, but this is not reciprocated; values around
0 indicate that neither is conditional on the other; and values approaching 1
indicate that both values are conditional on each other. If P[A|B] is the
larger conditional probability, the reciprocity is calculated as reciprocity
= ((P[B|A]/P[A|B]) - (P[A|B] - P[B|A])) * P[A|B].

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">netfacs.reciprocity(netfacs.data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>netfacs.data</code></td>
<td>
<p>object resulting from netfacs() function</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Function returns a data frame with each combination, the reciprocity
of conditional occurrence from -1 (one element entirely depends on the
other, but not vice versa) to 1 (both elements always occur together)
</p>
<p>The directions and conditional probabilities of both elements are
also returned

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">### how do angry facial expressions differ from non-angry ones?
data(emotions_set)
angry.face &lt;- netfacs(
  data = emotions_set[[1]],
  condition = emotions_set[[2]]$emotion,
  test.condition = "anger",
  ran.trials = 100,
  combination.size = 2
)

netfacs.reciprocity(angry.face)
