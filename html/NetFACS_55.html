<h2>Tests how much each element increases the specificity of all combinations it
is in</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function takes all elements and dyadic combinations of elements in a
netfacs object, goes through all combinations these elements are in, and
compares the specificity (strength with which the combination identifies the
test condition) of all combinations with the element and the same
combinations without the element, to test how much specificity the element
adds when added to a signal. Only works for netfacs objects based on
comparison between conditions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">specificity_increase(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>object resulting from <code>specificity</code> function</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Function returns a list with two data frames that include all
elements and first-order combinations that occur at all, the number of
combinations that each element/combination is part of, and how much adding
this element to a combination adds on average to its specificity, and how
often it occurs
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">### how do angry facial expressions differ from non-angry ones?
data(emotions_set)
angry.face &lt;- netfacs(
  data = emotions_set[[1]],
  condition = emotions_set[[2]]$emotion,
  test.condition = "anger",
  ran.trials = 10,
  combination.size = 2
)

spec &lt;- specificity(angry.face)
specificity_increase(spec)
</code></pre>
