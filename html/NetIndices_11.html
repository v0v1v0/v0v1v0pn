<h2>The trophic level and omnivory index</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the trophic level and omnivory index of each component of
a food web.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">TrophInd(Flow = NULL, Tij = t(Flow), 
         Import = NULL, Export = NULL, Dead = NULL)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Flow </code></td>
<td>
<p>network matrix with Flow[i,j] the flow from i (row) to j
(column); component positions in rows and columns must be the same;
if present, rownames or columnnames denote the compartment names.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Tij </code></td>
<td>
<p>network matrix where connectance is from column j to row i;
component positions in rows and columns must be the same ;
if present, rownames or columnnames denote the compartment names.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Import </code></td>
<td>
<p>vector with either the *indices* or the *names* of
<em>external</em> compartmens from where flow enters the network; the
indices point to the <b>column</b> positions in <code>Tij</code> (and the
row positions in Flow).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Export </code></td>
<td>
<p>vector with either the *indices* or the *names* of
<em>external</em> compartmens to where flow leaves the network; the indices
point to the <b>row</b> positions in <code>Tij</code> (and the column positions
in Flow).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Dead </code></td>
<td>
<p>vector with either the *indices* or the *names* of dead matter;
the indices point to <b>row</b> positions in <code>Tij</code>; the trophic level
of these components is assumed to be 1.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Primary producers, defined as those compartments that do not receive matter
from another internal compartment, will be assigned a trophic level of 1.
</p>
<p>In many trophic level calculations, it is also assumed that TL of detritus,
dissolved organic matter and other inert material (i.e. that does not feed)
is also = 1.
</p>
<p>If this is desired, these compartments have to be designated as "Dead"
(i.e. <code>Dead</code> should contain an index to row positions in <code>Tij</code>
of these compartments. 
</p>
<p>If not specified as "Dead", these compartments will have a TL &gt; 1 and
consequently the TL of other compartments will be higher too.
</p>
<p>The mathematical formulation of these indices can be found in the package
vignette - <em>vignette("NetIndices")</em>.
</p>
<p>The PDF can be found in the subdirectory ‘<span class="file">doc</span>’ of the NetIndices package.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a 2-columned data.frame with, for each compartment of the network the
following:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>TL </code></td>
<td>
<p>the trophic level of a compartment, defined as 1 + the weighted
average of the trophic levels of its food items.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>OI </code></td>
<td>
<p>the omnivory index, the variety in the trophic levels of a
consumer's food.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Up to version 1.4.1, the estimation of TL produced strange results in case
compartments feed on themselves. Then it was possible to produce negative
Trophic levels. From version 1.4.2, it is implemented that self-feeding does
not affect the TL of the compartment. Because of that, results may be 
different from the initial versions in such cases.
