  new.data.monad = NULL,
  seed = NULL,
  ...
)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Goodness of fit of network models has typically been established by evaluating how the structural characteristics of predicted networks 
compare to those of the observed network. When estimated in a Bayesian framework, this approach is equivalent to 
conducting posterior preditive checks on these structural quantities of interest. When <code>new.data.dyad</code> and/or <code>new.data.monad</code> are
passed that are different from those used in estimation, this is equivalent to conducting posterior predictive checks out-of-sample. 
</p>
<p>The set of structural features used to determine goodness of fit is somewhat arbitrary, and chosen mostly to incorporate various 
first order, second order, and (to the extent possible) third-order characteristics of the network. "Geodesics" focuses on the distribution over 
observed and predicted geodesic distances between nodes; "Indegree" and "Outdegree" focuses on the distribution over incoming and outgoing connections 
per node; "3-motifs" focus on a distribution over possible connectivity patterns between triads (i.e. the triadic census); "Dyad Shared Partners" focuses on the distribution
over the number of shared partners between any two dayds; "Edge Shared Partners" is similarly defined, but w.r.t. edges, rather than dyads; and finally
"Incoming K-stars" focuses on a frequency distribution over stars with k=1,... spokes. 
</p>
<p>Obtaining samples of the last three structural features can be very computationally expensive, and is discouraged on networks with more than 50
nodes.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">library(NetMix)
## Load datasets
data("lazega_dyadic")
data("lazega_monadic")

## Estimate model with 2 groups
lazega_mmsbm &lt;- mmsbm(SocializeWith ~ Coworkers,

## Plot observed (red) and simulated (gray) distributions over 
## indegrees
## (typically a larger number of samples would be taken) 
## (strictly requires ggplot2)
