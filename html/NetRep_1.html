<h2>Fast permutation procedure for testing network module replication</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions for assessing the replication/preservation of a network module's 
topology across datasets through permutation testing. This is suitable for 
networks that can be meaningfully inferred from multiple datasets. These 
include gene coexpression networks, protein-protein interaction networks, and
microbial interaction networks. Modules within these networks consist of 
groups of nodes that are particularly interesting: for example a group of 
tightly connected genes associated with a disease, groups of genes annotated
with the same term in the Gene Ontology database, or groups of interacting
microbial species, i.e. communities. Application of this method can answer
questions such as; (1) do the relationships between genes in a module 
replicate in an independent cohort? (2) are these gene coexpression modules
preserved across tissues or tissue specific? (3) are these modules conserved
across species? (4) are microbial communities preserved across multiple spatial
locations?
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The main function for this package is <code>modulePreservation</code>. 
Several functions for downstream are also provided: 
<code>networkProperties</code> for calculating the topological properties 
of a module, and <code>plotModule</code> for visualising a module.
