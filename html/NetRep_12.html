<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The preservation of network modules in a second
dataset is quantified by measuring the preservation of topological
properties between the <em>discovery</em> and <em>test</em> datasets. These 
properties are calculated not only from the interaction networks inferred
in each dataset, but also from the data used to infer those networks (e.g.
gene expression data) as well as the correlation structure between 
variables/nodes. Thus, all functions in the <code>NetRep</code> package have the 
following arguments: 
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>network</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>a list of interaction networks, one for each dataset.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>data</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>a list of data matrices used to infer those networks, one for each 
dataset.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>correlation</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>a list of matrices containing the pairwise correlation coefficients 
between variables/nodes in each dataset.
</p>
</dd> 
<dt>
<code>moduleAssignments</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>a list of vectors, one for each <em>discovery</em> dataset, containing 
the module assignments for each node in that dataset.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>modules</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>a list of vectors, one vector for each <em>discovery</em> dataset, containing
the names of the modules from that dataset to analyse.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>discovery</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>a vector indicating the names or indices of the previous arguments' 
lists to use as the <em>discovery</em> dataset(s) for the analyses.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>test</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>a list of vectors, one vector for each <em>discovery</em> dataset, 
containing the names or indices of the <code>network</code>, <code>data</code>, and 
<code>correlation</code> argument lists to use as the <em>test</em> dataset(s) 
for the analysis of each <em>discovery</em> dataset.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This data is used to provide concrete examples of the usage of these 
arguments in each package function.
</p>


<h3>Simulation details</h3>

<p>The <em>discovery</em> gene expression dataset (<code>"discovery_data"</code>)
containing 30 samples and 150 genes was simulated to contain four distinct
modules of sizes 20, 25, 30, and 35 genes. Data for each module were
simulated as:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
     G^{(w)}_{simulated} = E^{(w)} r_i + \sqrt{1 - r^2_i} \epsilon
   </code>
</p>

<p>Where <code class="reqn">E^{(w)}</code> is the simulated module's <em>summary vector</em>, 
<code class="reqn">r</code> is the simulated module's <em>node contributions</em> for each gene,
and <code class="reqn">\epsilon</code> is the error term drawn from a standard normal 
distribution. <code class="reqn">E^{(w)}</code> and <code class="reqn">r</code> were simulated by bootstrapping 
(sampling with replacement) samples and genes from the corresponding 
vectors in modules 63, 51, 57, and 50 discovered in the liver tissue gene 
expression data from a 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE2814">publicly 
available</a> mouse dataset (see reference <em>(1)</em> for details on the 
dataset and network discovery). The remaining 40 genes that were not part 
of any module were simulated by randomly selecting 40 liver genes and 
bootstrapping 30 samples and adding the noise term, <code class="reqn">\epsilon</code>. A
vector of module assignments was created ("module_labels") in which
each gene was labelled with a number 1-4 corresponding to the module they
were simulated to be coexpressed with, or a label of 0 for the for the 40
"background" genes not participating in any module. The correlation
structure ("discovery_correlation") was calculated as the Pearson's
correlation coefficient between genes 
(cor(discovery_data)). Edge weights in the
interaction network ("discovery_network") were calculated as the
absolute value of the correlation coefficient exponentiated to the power 5
(abs(discovery_correlation)^5).
</p>
<p>An independent test dataset ("test_data") containing the same 150
genes as the <em>discovery</em> dataset but 30 different samples was
simulated as above. Modules 1 and 4 (containing 20 and 35 genes
respectively) were simulated to be preserved using the same equation
above, where the <em>summary vector</em> <code class="reqn">E^{(w)}</code> was bootstrapped from
the same liver modules (modules 63 and 50) as in the <em>discovery</em> and
with identical <em>node contributions</em> <code class="reqn">r</code> as in the
<em>discovery</em> dataset. Genes in modules 2 and 3 were simulated as
"background" genes, <em>i.e.</em> not preserved as described above. The
correlation structure between genes in the <em>test</em> dataset
("test_correlation") and the interaction network
("test_network") were calculated the same way as in the
<em>discovery</em> dataset.
</p>
<p>The random seed used for the simulations was 37.
