<h2>Load a 'bigMatrix' (deprecated)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>'bigMatrix'</code> class is no longer implemented in the <code>NetRep</code>
package: the shared memory approach was incompatabile with high performance
compute clusters, so the parallel permutation procedure has been translated
into C++ code (which is also much faster). The <code>disk.matrix</code>
class should now be used instead when analysing large datasets.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">load.bigMatrix(backingfile)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>backingfile</code></td>
<td>
<p>path to the backingfile for the <code>'bigMatrix'</code>. The
file extension must be omitted.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function will convert <code>'bigMatrix'</code> data saved by previous 
versions of <span class="pkg">NetRep</span> to a serialized R matrix saved in the same location
and return a <code>disk.matrix</code> object with the associated file path.
If this conversion has taken place already the function will throw a warning.
</p>
<p>This function will also convert the <code>'bigMatrix'</code> descriptor file to a 
<code>big.matrix</code> descriptor file to preserve 
compatability with functions in the <span class="pkg">bigmemory</span> package. If this 
functionality is not required, the files with the extensions ".bin" and 
".desc" may be removed.
</p>
<p>A note for users using multi-node high performance clusters:
<code>'big.matrix'</code> objects are not suitable for general usage. Access
to file-backed shared memory segments on multi-node systems is very slow
due to consistency checks performed by the operating system. This becomes
exponentially worse the more R sessions there are simultaneously accessing
the shared memory segment, e.g. through parallel <span class="pkg">foreach</span> loops.
