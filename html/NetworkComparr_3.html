<h2>Statistical Comparison of Networks based on Edgelists</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This permutation-based hypothesis test assesses the differences between two networks based on the invariance measures of the R package 'NetworkComparisonTest' by van Borkulo et al. (2022): global strength invariance, network structure invariance, edge invariance, and various centrality measures. The global strength invariance represents the differences in the total number of all edges. The network structure invariance involves only the edge that differs the most in its count. The edge invariance covers the differences of the specified individual edges. The centrality measures covers the differences regarding the importance of the individual nodes. Edgelists of two comparable group networks from dependent or independent samples are used as input. These edgelists can be generated from individual graphical network representations, such as concept maps. The networks can be directed or undirected.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">CEN(EL1, EL2, noc, it = 10000,
             paired = FALSE, directed = FALSE, abs = TRUE, plot = TRUE,
             test.edges = TRUE, edges = "all", progressbar = TRUE,
             p.adjust.methods = c("none", "holm", "hochberg","hommel",
                                   "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr"),
             test.centrality = TRUE, centrality = c("all"), cen.nodes = "all",
             test.bridge.centrality = FALSE, bridge.centrality = c("all"),
             brg.nodes= "all", communities = NULL, useCommunities = "all",
             verbose = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>EL1</code></td>
<td>
<p>Edgelist 1. One of two edgelists containing the subject number and the coding of the network. The object type is "data.frame", the columns must be labeled "person", "from" and "to". "Person" contains the subject number. For dependent samples, the same person must have the same label in both edgelists. For independent samples, the same subject number cannot occur twice in the two edgelists. "From" indicates where an edge begins, "to" indicates where it ends. For undirected networks, an edge can be specified in one direction only. The direction is irrelevant (e.g., from 1 to 2, or from 2 to 1). The nodes must be numbered and must not have labels of the class character. The example serves as an orientation for the structure of the data frame.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>EL2</code></td>
<td>
<p>Edgelist 2. The other of two edgelists containing the subject number and the coding of the network. The object type is "data.frame", the columns must be labeled "person", "from" and "to". "Person" contains the subject number. For dependent samples, the same person must have the same label in both edgelists. For independent samples, the same subject number cannot occur twice in the two edgelists. "From" indicates where an edge begins, "to" indicates where it ends. For undirected networks, an edge can be specified in one direction only. The direction is irrelevant (e.g., from 1 to 2, or from 2 to 1). The nodes must be numbered and must not have labels of the class character. The example serves as an orientation for the structure of the data frame.</p>
</td>

<p>Number of nodes. Total number of nodes that occur in the networks.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>it</code></td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>paired</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Can be TRUE or FALSE to indicate whether the samples are dependent or not. If paired is TRUE, relabeling is performed within each pair of observations. If paired is FALSE, relabeling is not restricted to pairs of observations. Note that, currently, dependent data is assumed to entail one group measured twice. Defaults to FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>directed</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Can be TRUE or FALSE to indicate whether the networks are directed or not. Undirected networks have edges without directions. For directed networks, the edges are often represented with arrows in one direction, however, the arrow can also point in both directions. Defaults to FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>abs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Should global strength consider the absolute value of edge weights, or the raw value (i.e., global expected influence)? Important if the edgelists contain negative values. Defaults to TRUE.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Should the networks be displayed graphically? Defaults to TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<td>
<p>Logical. Can be TRUE or FALSE to indicate whether or not differences in individual edges should be tested. Defaults to TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>edges</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character or list. When 'all', differences between all individual edges are tested. When provided a list with one or more pairs of nodes, the provided edges are tested. The list must contain the two nodes that delimit the edge, e.g., edges = list(c(1,2), c(3,2)).</p>

<td><code>p.adjust.methods</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character. Can be one of "holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", or "none". To control (or not) for testing of multiple edges. Defaults to "none".</p>

<td>
<p>Logical. Should centrality metrics be compared across networks? Defaults to FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>centrality</code></td>
<td>
<p>Type of centrality metrics to test. Can be either "all" or individually selected. For undirected networks it can be any of c("Closeness", "Betweenness", "Strength", "ExpectedInfluence"). For directed networks it can be any of c("Closeness", "Betweenness", "InStrength", "OutStrength", "InExpectedInfluence", "OutExpectedInfluence"). For more information see 'centrality'.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>communities</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of community assignments for each node (e.g., c("Comm1", "Comm1", "Comm2", "Comm2)). The ordering of this vector should correspond to the order of the nodes. Can also be in list format (e.g., list("Comm1"=c(1:3), "Comm2"=c(4:6))). For more information see 'bridge'.</p>
