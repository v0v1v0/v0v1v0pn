<h2>Distance Measures for Networks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Network has gathered much attention from many disciplines, as many of real data
can be well represented in the relational form. The concept of distance - or, metric - between
two networks is the starting point for inference on population of networks. <span class="pkg">NetworkDistance</span> package
provides a not-so-comprehensive collection of distance measures for measuring dissimilarity between two network objects.
Data should be supplied as <em>adjacency</em> matrices, where we support three formats of data representation;
<code>matrix</code> object in <span class="pkg">R</span> base, <code>network</code> class from <span class="pkg">network</span> package, and <code>igraph</code> class from
<span class="pkg">igraph</span> package.
