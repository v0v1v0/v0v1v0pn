<h2>Simulated Interbank Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A simulated dataset with interbank assets, liabilities, capital buffer and weights for
125 "banks". The code to generate the data is on the examples.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 125 rows and 5 variables</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# Simulated data for ilustration purposes

# Setting Seed
set.seed(1100)

# Heavy tailed assets
assets &lt;- rlnorm(125, 0, 2)

# Heavy tailed liabilities
liabilities &lt;- rlnorm(125, 0, 2) 
liabilities[liabilities &lt; 4] &lt;- runif(length(liabilities[liabilities &lt; 4]))

# Making sure assets = liabilities
assets &lt;- sum(liabilities) * (assets/sum(assets))

# Buffer as a function of assets
buffer &lt;- pmax(0.01, runif(length(liabilities))*liabilities + abs(rnorm(125, 4, 2.6)))

# Weights as a function of assets, buffer and liabilities
weights &lt;- (assets + liabilities + buffer + 1) + rlnorm(125, 0, 1)

# creating data.frame
