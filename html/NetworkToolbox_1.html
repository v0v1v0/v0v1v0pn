<h2>NetworkToolboxâ€“package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements network analysis and graph theory measures used
in neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychology.
Methods include various filtering methods and approaches such as
threshold, dependency, Information Filtering Networks, and Efficiency-Cost Optimization.
Brain methods include the recently developed Connectome Predictive Modeling.
Also implements several network measures including local network characteristics
(e.g., centrality), global network characteristics (e.g., clustering coefficient),
and various other measures associated with the reliability and
reproducibility of network analysis.
