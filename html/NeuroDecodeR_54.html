<h2>A result metric (RM) that calculates main decoding accuracy measures</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This result metric calculate the zero-one loss, the normalized rank, and the
mean of the decision values. This is also an S3 object which has an
associated plot function to display the results.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rm_main_results(
  ndr_container_or_object = NULL,
  include_norm_rank_results = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ndr_container_or_object</code></td>
<td>
<p>The purpose of this argument is to make the
constructor of the rm_main_results feature preprocessor work with the
magrittr pipe (%&gt;%) operator. This argument should almost never be directly
set by the user to anything other than NULL. If this is set to the default
value of NULL, then the constructor will return a rm_main_results object.
If this is set to an ndr container, then a rm_main_results object will be
added to the container and the container will be returned. If this argument
is set to another ndr object, then both that ndr object as well as a new
rm_main_results object will be added to a new container and the container
will be returned.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>include_norm_rank_results</code></td>
<td>
<p>An argument specifying if the normalized
rank and decision value results should be saved. If this is a Boolean set
to TRUE, then the normalized rank and decision values for the correct
category will be calculated. If this is a Boolean set to FALSE then the
normalized rank and decision values will not be calculated. If this is a
string set to "only_same_train_test_time", then the normalized rank and
decision values will only be calculated when for results when training and
testing at the same time. Not returning the full results can speed up the
run-time of the code and will use less memory so this can be useful for
large data sets.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Like all result metrics, this result metric has functions to aggregate
results after completing each set of cross-validation classifications, and
also after completing all the resample runs. The results should then be
available in the DECODING_RESULTS object returned by the cross-validator.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This constructor creates an NDR result metric object with the class
<code>rm_main_results</code>. Like all NDR result metric objects, this result
metric will be used by a cross-validator to create a measure of decoding
accuracy by aggregating the results after all cross-validation splits have
been run, and after all resample runs have completed.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># If you only want to use the rm_main_results(), then you can put it in a
# list by itself and pass it to the cross-validator.
the_rms &lt;- list(rm_main_results())
