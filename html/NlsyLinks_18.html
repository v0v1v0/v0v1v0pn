<h2>Extra outcome variables in the NLSY79</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset is provided primarily to facilitate documentation examples.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 11,495 observations on the following 6 variables. There is one row per subject.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>SubjectTag</strong> The ID value assigned by NLS to the first subject.  For Gen1 Subjects, this is their "CaseID" (ie, R00001.00).  For Gen2 subjects, this is their "CID" (ie, C00001.00).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>SubjectID</strong> The ID value assigned by NLS to the first subject.  For Gen1 Subjects, this is their "CaseID" (ie, R00001.00).  For Gen2 subjects, this is their "CID" (ie, C00001.00).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Generation</strong> The generation of the subject.  Values are either 1 or 2, representing Gen1 and Gen2.  Note that this variable is not a  <code>factor</code> (in contrast with data frames like
Links79Pair).  This dataset is supposed to mimic the dataset provided by the researcher, which typically will not have been converted to a <code>factor</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>HeightZGenderAge</strong> The subject's height, standardized by gender and age (see Details).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>WeightZGenderAge</strong> The subject's weight, standardized by gender and age (see Details).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>AfqtRescaled2006Gaussified</strong> Armed Forces Qualification Test Score (Gen1 only; see Details).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Afi</strong> Self-reported age of first intercourse (Gen1 only; see Details).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Afm</strong> Self-reported age of first menstruation (Gen1 only; see Details).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>MathStandardized</strong> Standardized PIAT Math scores (Gen2 only; see Details).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>SubjectTag</code> variable uniquely identify subjects.  For Gen2
subjects, the SubjectTag is identical to their CID (ie, C00001.00 -the
SubjectID assigned in the NLSY79-Children files).  However for Gen1
subjects, the SubjectTag is their CaseID (ie, R00001.00), with "00"
appended.  This manipulation is necessary to identify subjects uniquely in
inter-generational datasets.  A Gen1 subject with an ID of 43 has a
<code>SubjectTag</code> of 4300.  The SubjectTags of her four children remain
4301, 4302, 4303, and 4304.
</p>
<p>For Gen2, an NLSY79 variable of <code>MathStandardized</code> is C05801.00.
</p>
<p><code>Afi</code> and <code>Afm</code>, values were simplified
(to one value per subject) by Kelly Williams in Sept 2010.
</p>
<p>The variables for height and weight were manipulated in R files available in a
<a href="https://github.com/nlsy-links/nlsy-links-determination-2017/tree/master/data-public/derived">repository</a> available to the public.
