<h2>Data of the Openness scale of a personality test</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are the data of the Openness subscale of International Personality Item Pool (ipip.ori.org). This subscale consists of 5 items: 1 = <em>I am full of ideas</em>, 2 = <em>I avoid difficult reading material</em>, 3 = <em>I carry the conversation to a higher level</em>, 4 = <em>I spend time reflecting on things</em>, and 5 = <em>I will not probe deeply into a subject</em>. Each item is scored on a 6-point response scale with answer categories 1 = very inaccurate, 2 = moderately inaccurate, 3 = slightly inaccurate, 4 = slightly accurate, 5 = moderately accurate, and 6 = very accurate. The Openness scale score corresponds to the sum of the individual item scores, with items 2 and 5 being reverse scored. The raw Openness scale score ranges between 5 and 30. A higher score is indicative of higher levels of curiosity, intellectualism, imagination, and aesthetic interests (McCrae, 1994).
</p>
<p>The data were collected as part of the Synthetic Apeture Personality Assessment (SAPA http://sapa-project.org) web-based personality assessment project.
