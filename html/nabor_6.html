<h2>Wrapper classes for k-NN searches enabling repeated queries of the same tree</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>WKNNF</code> and <code>WKNND</code> are reference classes that wrap 
C++ classes of the same name that include a space-efficient k-d tree along 
with the target data points. They have <code>query</code> methods with exactly 
the same interface as the <code>knn</code> function. One important point compared
with <code>knn</code> - they must be intialised with floating point data and you 
are responsible for this - see <code>storage.mode</code>) and the example 
below.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>WKNNF</code> expects and returns matrices in R's standard (double, 8
bytes) data type but uses floats internally. <code>WKNND</code> uses doubles 
throughout. When retaining large numbers of points, the <code>WKNNF</code> 
objects will have a small memory saving, especially if tree building is 
delayed.
</p>
<p>The constructor for WKNN objects includes a logical flag indicating whether
to build the tree immediately (default: <code>TRUE</code>) or (when <code>FALSE</code>)
to delay building the tree until a query is made (this happens 
automatically when required).
</p>


<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>The use of <code>WKNN</code> objects will incur a performance
penalty for single queries of trees with &lt; ~1000 data points. This is 
because of the overhead associated with the R wrapper class. It therefore 
makes sense to use <code>knn</code> in these circumstances.
</p>
<p>If you wish to make repeated queries of the same target data, then using 
<code>WKNN</code> objects can give significant advantages. If you are going to 
make repeated queries with the same set of query points (presumably against
different target data), you can obtain benefits in some cases by converting
the query points into WKNNF objects without building the trees.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Basic usage
# load sample data consisting of list of 3 separate 3d pointets
data(kcpoints)
# build a tree and query it with two different sets of points
w1 &lt;- WKNNF(kcpoints[[1]])
w1q2 &lt;- w1$query(kcpoints[[2]], k=5, eps=0, radius=0)
str(w1q2)
w1q3 &lt;- w1$query(kcpoints[[3]], k=5, eps=0, radius=0)
# note that there will be small difference between WKNNF and knn due to loss 
# of precision in the double to float conversion when a WKNNF tree is 
# built and queried.
stopifnot(all.equal(
 knn(data=kcpoints[[1]], query=kcpoints[[2]], k=5, eps=0, radius=0),
 w1q2, tolerance=1e-6))
 
## storage mode: must be double
m=matrix(1:24, ncol=3)
storage.mode(m)
# this will generate an error unless we change to a double
w=tools::assertCondition(WKNND(m), "error")
storage.mode(m)="double"
w=WKNND(matrix(m, ncol=3))

## construct wrapper objects but delay tree construction
w1 &lt;- WKNNF(kcpoints[[1]], FALSE)
# query triggers tree construction
w1q2 &lt;- w1$query(kcpoints[[2]], k=5, eps=0, radius=0)
str(w1q2)

## queries using wrapper objects
wkcpoints &lt;-lapply(kcpoints, WKNNF, FALSE)
# query all 3 point sets against first
# this will trigger tree construction only for pointset 1
qall &lt;- lapply(wkcpoints, 
  function(x) wkcpoints[[1]]$queryWKNN(x$.CppObject, k=5, eps=0, radius=0))
str(qall)
