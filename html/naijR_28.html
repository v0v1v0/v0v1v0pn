<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Objects for Representing the Federal States of Nigeria
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">states(states, gpz = NULL, all = TRUE, warn = TRUE)

is_state(x)

as_state(x)

## S3 method for class 'states'
print(x, ...)

## S3 method for class 'states'
c(...)

## S3 method for class 'states'
x[[i, exact = TRUE]]

## S3 method for class 'states'
x[i]

## S3 method for class 'states'
na.exclude(object, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>states</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector with strings representing one or more
States of Nigeria. If missing, the function will return a <code>states</code>
object containing all the States.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gpz</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>NULL</code> (the default) or, case insensitively, one or more of
the following strings: <code>"nc", "ne", "nw", "se", "ss"</code> and <code>"sw"</code>
(see "Details").</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>all</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical; whether to include the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)
in the result.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>warn</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical; issue a warning when one or more elements are not
actually States (i.e. they were misspelt).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>For <code>is_state</code> a vector to be tested. For <code>as_state</code>, a
string representing a State that shares its name with one of its Local
Government Areas.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Arguments used for methods. See documentation of generic
for details.</p>

<td><code>i, exact</code></td>
<td>
<p>See help file for <code>?Extract</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<p>An object of class <code>regions</code></p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>gpz</code> represents a geopolitical zone which, in the Nigerian
context, is a national subdivision that groups contiguous states that bear
certain socio-cultural and political similarities. Historically, they arise
from sub-national administrative divisions known as 'Regions' that existed
at the time of the country's independence. There are at present 6 such
zones - North-Central, North-East, North-West, South-East,South-South and
South-West.
</p>
<p>For <code>is_state</code>, An element-wise check of a supplied vector is carried
out. To test an entire vector and return a single boolean value, functions
such as <code>base::all</code> or <code>base::any</code> should be used (see examples).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The States of Nigeria as a whole or by zones, as an S3 object
of class <code>states</code>. <code>is_state</code> returns a logical vector.of same
length as the input. If the input object is not even of type
<code>character</code>, return the object unaltered, with a warning. In the case
of <code>as_state</code>, an object of class <code>states</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><code>is_state</code> throws a warning, when a missing value is among the
elements. It works only for atomic vectors, throwing an error when this
is not the case or when <code>NULL</code> is passed to it. This design decision
was made to allow rapid iteration through data frames without interruption,
since spelling mistakes tend to be common.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">states()  # lists names of all States
states(gpz = "se")  # lists States in South-East zone
all(is_state(naijR::states()))
is_state(c("Maryland", "Baden-Baden", "Plateau", "Sussex"))

# With coercion
kt.st &lt;- states("Katsina")  # Ensure this is a State, not an LGA.
kt.lg &lt;- suppressWarnings(as_lga(kt.st))
is_state(kt.st)             # TRUE
is_lga(kt.lg)               # TRUE

## Where there's no ambiguity, it doesn't make sense to coerce
## This kind of operation ends with an error
## Not run: 
as_state("Kano")
as_lga("Michika")

## End(Not run)
