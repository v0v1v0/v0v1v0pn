<h2>DS-LIVE</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Double selection plus logistic regression instrumental variable estimator (DS-LIVE). A three-step approach to estimate the dummy endogenous treatment effect using high-dimensional instruments in a penalized logistic regression model and double selection. This method accommodates the binary endogenous variable as well as the high-dimensionality for both the reduced form and structural equation models.
</p>

  y,
  x,
  z,
  D,
  criterion = c("BIC", "CV"),
  penalty = c("SCAD", "MCP", "lasso"),
  family = c("gaussian", "binomial", "poisson", "multinomial", "cox", "mgaussian"),
  alpha = 1,
  gamma = 3.7,

<p>The criterion by which to select the regularization parameter. One of "BIC", "CV", CV means cross-validation, default is "BIC".</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>penalty</code></td>
<td>
<p>This parameter takes effect when the creterion is CV. Quantitative for family="gaussian", or family="poisson" (non-negative counts). For family="binomial" should be either a factor with two levels, or a two-column matrix of counts or proportions (the second column is treated as the target class; for a factor, the last level in alphabetical order is the target class). For family="multinomial", can be a nc&gt;=2 level factor, or a matrix with nc columns of counts or proportions. For either "binomial" or "multinomial", if y is presented as a vector, it will be coerced into a factor. For family="cox", y should be a two-column matrix with columns named 'time' and 'status'. The latter is a binary variable, with '1' indicating death, and '0' indicating right censored. The function Surv() in package survival produces such a matrix. For family="mgaussian", y is a matrix of quantitative responses.</p>

<td><code>family</code></td>
<td>
<p>Only applied to the first step in the algorithm, the regression of y on x. Quantitative for family="gaussian", or family="poisson" (non-negative counts).

<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>Tuning parameter for the Mnet estimator which controls the relative contributions from the MCP/SCAD penalty and the ridge, or L2 penalty. alpha=1 is equivalent to MCP/SCAD penalty, while alpha=0 would be equivalent to ridge regression. However, alpha=0 is not supported; alpha may be arbitrarily small, but not exactly 0.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The DS-IV algorithm consists of the following three steps: In the first step, it estimates the coefficients (betaX) and select the important control variables set (denoted by c1) which are helpful to predict the outcome variable y using regularization methods for the data (y; x). In the second step, using a penalized logistic regression model, it selects both important control variables x (the selected control variables set is denoted by cx) and instrumental variables z for the endogenous treatment D. This step is crucial in the algorithm. Because it can estimate the optimal instrument using high-dimensional IVs as well as select additional important control variables which might be missed in the first step but are nonetheless important to the treatment variable. In the third step, it computes the post-double-selection LIVE estimator for the dummy endogenous treatment effect based on the predicted treatment variable D and the union of selected control variables in the first two variable selection steps denoted by c3 = (c1 union cx).
