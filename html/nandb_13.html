<h2>Create a cross-correlated brightness time-series.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a stack of images <code>img</code>, use the first <code>frames_per_set</code> of them to
create one cross-correlated brightness image, the next <code>frames_per_set</code> of
them to create the next and so on to get a time-series of cross-correlated
brightness images.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cc_brightness_timeseries(
  img,
  frames_per_set,
  overlap = FALSE,
  ch1 = 1,
  ch2 = 2,
  thresh = NULL,
  detrend = FALSE,
  quick = FALSE,
  filt = NULL,
  parallel = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>img</code></td>
<td>
<p>A 4-dimensional array of images indexed by <code>img[y, x, channel, frame]</code> (an object of class ijtiff::ijtiff_img). The image to perform the
calculation on. To perform this on a file that has not yet been read in,
set this argument to the path to that file (a string).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>frames_per_set</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of frames with which to calculate the
successive cross-correlated brightnesses.
</p>
<p>This may discard some images, for example if 175 frames are in the input and
<code>frames_per_set = 50</code>, then the last 25 are discarded. If bleaching or/and
thresholding are selected, they are performed on the whole image stack before
the sectioning is done for calculation of cross-correlated brightnesses.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overlap</code></td>
<td>
<p>A boolean. If <code>TRUE</code>, the windows used to calculate brightness
are overlapped, if <code>FALSE</code>, they are not. For example, for a 20-frame image
series with 5 frames per set, if the windows are not overlapped, then the
frame sets used are 1-5, 6-10, 11-15 and 16-20; whereas if they are
overlapped, the frame sets are 1-5, 2-6, 3-7, 4-8 and so on up to 16-20.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ch1</code></td>
<td>
<p>A natural number. The index of the first channel to use.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ch2</code></td>
<td>
<p>A natural number. The index of the second channel to use.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>thresh</code></td>
<td>
<p>Do you want to apply an intensity threshold prior to
calculating cross-correlated brightness (via
<code>autothresholdr::mean_stack_thresh()</code>)? If so, set your thresholding method
here. If this is a single value, that same threshold will be applied to
both channels. If this is a length-2 vector or list, then these two
thresholds will be applied to channels 1 and 2 respectively. A value of
<code>NA</code> for either channel gives no thresholding for that channel.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>detrend</code></td>
<td>
<p>Detrend your data with <code>detrendr::img_detrend_rh()</code>. This is
the best known detrending method for brightness analysis. For more
fine-grained control over your detrending, use the <code>detrendr</code> package. To
detrend one channel and not the other, specify this as a length 2 vector.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quick</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>FALSE</code> repeats the detrending procedure (which has some inherent
randomness) a few times to hone in on the best detrend. <code>TRUE</code> is quicker,
performing the routine only once. <code>FALSE</code> is better.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>filt</code></td>
<td>
<p>Do you want to smooth (<code>filt = 'smooth'</code>) or median (<code>filt = 'median'</code>) filter the cross-correlated brightness image using
<code>smooth_filter()</code> or <code>median_filter()</code> respectively? If selected, these are
invoked here with a filter radius of 1 and with the option <code>na_count = TRUE</code>. A value of <code>NA</code> for either channel gives no thresholding for that
channel. If you want to smooth/median filter the cross-correlated
brightness image in a different way, first calculate the cross-correlated
brightnesses without filtering (<code>filt = NULL</code>) using this function and then
perform your desired filtering routine on the result.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parallel</code></td>
<td>
<p>Would you like to use multiple cores to speed up this
function? If so, set the number of cores here, or to use all available
cores, use <code>parallel = TRUE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
