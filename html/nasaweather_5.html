<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data originated from the National Hurricane Center's archive of
Tropical Cyclone Reports (<a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/">http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/</a>). This dataset
was hand-scraped from best track tables in the individual tropical cyclone
reports (PDF, HTML and Microsoft Word) by Jon Hobbs.
</p>
<p>The Tropical Cyclone Reports had a variety of storm type designations and
there appeared to be no consistent naming convention for cyclones that were
not hurricanes, tropical depressions, or tropical storms. Many of these
designations have been combined into the "Extratropical" category in this
dataset.
