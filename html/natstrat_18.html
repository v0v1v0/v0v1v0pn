<h2>Sample integer solution from linear programming solution with sample sizes correct in expectation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The linear programming solution of <code>balance_LP()</code> that is used
within <code>optimize_controls()</code> sometimes selects fractional control units.
Here, we select any unit the linear programming solution chose with coefficient 1.
Then, we select sample each unit with a fractional solution with
probability equal to the linear programming solution. The total sample
size is then correct in expectation. Used within <code>optimize_controls()</code>
if <code>correct_sizes = FALSE</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">randomized_rounding_expectation(o, N, n_comp)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>o</code></td>
<td>
<p>linear programming results, as found in the 'o' element of the
returned list from <code>balance_LP()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>N</code></td>
<td>
<p>the total number of available controls in the data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Dataframe with two columns: <code>pr</code>, which contains
the coefficient determined for that unit from the linear programming
solution, and <code>select</code>, a boolean vector stating whether that
unit was selected for inclusion by randomized rounding.
