<h2>Plot weights for propensity score estimation in the navigated weighting</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Plots weight of each observation in the score condition <code class="reqn">\omega(\pi)</code> for
propensity score estimation and estimated propensity score distribution 
in the navigated weighting.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">plot_omega(object, relative = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class “nawt”, usually, a result of a call to <code>nawt</code>.
Note that it cannot be used when the <code>object</code> is a result of a call to
<code>nawt</code> where <code>method = "both"</code> and <code>twostep = FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>relative</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical value indicating whether or not relative weights 
standardized to have mean one are shown.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The x-axis shows estimated propensity scores, and the y-axis shows weight of 
each observation in propensity score estimation. When <code>estimand = "ATE"</code>,
the navigated weighting estimates two propensity scores for each observation;
one for estimating the average of the potential outcomes with treatment and  
the other for estimating the average of the potential outcomes without 
treatment. Therefore, there are two weighting functions for estimating two 
sets of propensity scores and two propensity score distributions. Points 
rising to the right and a solid curve represent the weighting functions and 
distribution of propensity scores for estimating the average of the potential
outcomes without treatment whereas points rising to the left and a dashed 
curve represent the weighting functions and distribution of propensity scores
for estimating the average of the potential outcomes with treatment.
