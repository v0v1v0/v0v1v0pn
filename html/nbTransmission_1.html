<h2>Clusters the infectors based on their transmission probabilities</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function <code>clusterInfectors</code> uses either kernel density estimation or
hierarchical clustering to cluster the infectors for each infectee. This clustering
provides a way to separate out the few top possible infectors for each infectee
if there is such a cluster.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">clusterInfectors(
  df,
  indIDVar,
  pVar,
  clustMethod = c("n", "kd", "hc_absolute", "hc_relative"),
  cutoff
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the dateset with transmission probabilities (column <code>pVar</code>),
individual IDs (columns <code>&lt;indIDVar&gt;.1</code> and <code>&lt;indIDVar&gt;.2</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>indIDVar</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name (in quotes) of the individual ID columns
(data frame <code>df</code> must have variables called <code>&lt;indIDVar&gt;.1</code>
and <code>&lt;indIDVar&gt;.2</code>).</p>

one of <code>"n", "kd", "hc_absolute", "hc_relative"</code> (see details).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function provides a way to find the most likely infectors for each infectee
using various clustering methods indicated by the <code>clustmethod</code>.
The methods can be one of <code>c("n", "kd", "hc_constant", "hc_relative")</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>clustMethod == "n"</code> then this function simply assigns the top n possible 
infectors in the top cluster where n is defined by the value of <code>cutoff</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>clustMethod == "kd"</code> then kernel density estimation is used to split the infectors.
The density for the probabilities for all infectors is estimated using a binwidth defined
by the value of <code>cutoff</code>. If the density is made up of at least two separate curves
(separated by a region where the density drops to 0) then the infectors with probabilities
greater than the lowest 0 region are assigned to the high probability cluster. If the density of the
probabilities does not drop to 0 then all infectors are assigned to the low probability cluster 
(indicating no real clustering).
</p>
<p>If <code>clustMethod == "hc_absolute"</code> or <code>clustMethod == "hc_relative"</code>, then
hierarchical clustering with minimum distance is used to split the possible infectors
into two clusters. This method functionally splits the infectors by the largest gap
in their probabilities.
</p>
<p>Then if <code>clustMethod == "hc_absolute"</code>, those infectees
where the gap between the two clusters is less than <code>cutoff</code> have all of their
possible infectors reassigned to the low probability cluster (indicating no real clustering).
If <code>clustMethod == "hc_relative"</code>, then all infectees where the gap between the two
clusters is less than <code>cutoff</code> times the second largest gap in probabilities
are reassigned to the low probability cluster (indicating no real clustering).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The original data frame (<code>df</code>) with a new column called <code>cluster</code>
which is a factor variable with value <code>1</code> if the infector is in the high probability cluster
or <code>2</code> if the infector is in the low probability cluster.

<pre><code class="language-R">
## Use the nbResults data frame included in the package which has the results
