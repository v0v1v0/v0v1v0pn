<h2>Read NetCDF-CF timeSeries featuretype</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function reads a timeseries discrete sampling geometry NetCDF file and 
returns a list containing the file's contents.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">read_timeseries_dsg(nc_file, read_data = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nc_file</code></td>
<td>
<p>character file path to the nc file to be read.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>read_data</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical whether to read metadata only or not.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The current implementation checks several NetCDF-CF specific conventions prior to attempting to 
read the file. The Conventions and featureType global attributes are checked but not
strictly required. 
</p>
<p>Variables with standard_name and/or cf_role of station_id and/or timeseries_id are 
searched for to indicate which variable is the 'timeseries identifier'. The function stops 
if one is not found.
</p>
<p>All variables are introspected for a coordinates attribute. This attribute is used to determine
which variables are coordinate variables. If none are found an attempt to infer data 
variables by time and timeseries_id dimensions is made.
</p>
<p>The coordinates variables are introspected and their standard_names used to determine
which coordinate they are. Lat, lon, and time are required, height is not. 
</p>
<p>Variables with a coordinates attribute are assumed to be the 'data variables'.
</p>
<p>Data variables are traversed and their metadata and data content put into lists within the main
response list.
</p>
<p>See the timeseries vignette for more information.

<p>list containing the contents of the NetCDF file.
