<h2>ncpen: A package for non-convex penalized estimation for generalized linear models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package fits the generalized linear models with various non-convex penalties.
Supported regression models are Gaussian (linear), binomial Logit (logistic), multinomial Logit,
Poisson and Cox proportional hazard.
A unified algorithm is implemented in <b>ncpen</b> based on the convex concave procedure
or difference convex algorithm that can be applied to most of existing non-convex penalties.
The available penalties in the package are
the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator(LASSO),
smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD),
minimax concave penalty (MCP),
truncated <code class="reqn">\ell_1</code>-penalty (TLP),
clipped LASSO (CLASSO),
sparse bridge (SRIDGE),
modified bridge (MBRIDGE),
and modified log (MLOG) penalties.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package accepts a design matrix <code class="reqn">X</code> and vector of responses <code class="reqn">y</code>,
and produces the regularization path over a grid of values for the tuning parameter <code>lambda</code>.
Also provides user-friendly processes for plotting, selecting tuning parameters using cross-validation or generalized information criterion (GIC),
<code class="reqn">\ell_2</code>-regularization, penalty weights, standardization and intercept.
