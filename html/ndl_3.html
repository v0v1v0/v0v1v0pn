<h2>Analysis of Model Fit for Naive Discriminatory Reader Models
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute an analysis of individual variable contributions or model
comparisons for one or more Naive Discriminatory Reader model
fits.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> ## S3 method for class 'ndlClassify'
anova(object, ..., statistic = "deviance", test = "Chisq")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object, ...</code></td>
<td>

<p>Object(s) of class <code>"ndlClassify"</code>, typically the result of a
call to <code>ndlClassify</code>, or a list of <code>objects</code> for the
<code>ndlClassifylist</code> method.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>statistic</code></td>
<td>

<p>A character string specifying the statistic describing the fit
that is to be compared, by default <code>deviance</code>, which is
obtained from the object(s).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>test</code></td>
<td>

<p>A character string, determining the statistical method by which
the significance of the comparison are done, by default the
Chi-squared test (<code>Chisq</code>).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Currently, comparison of the terms of a single model or multiple
models is only implemented based on the <code>deviance</code>
statistic.
</p>
<p>Specifying a single object gives a sequential analysis of deviance
table for that fit.  That is, the reductions in the residual
deviance as each term of the formula is added in turn are given in
as the rows of a table, plus the residual deviances themselves.
</p>
<p>If more than one object is specified, the table has a row for the
residual degrees of freedom and deviance for each model.  For all
but the first model, the change in degrees of freedom and deviance
is also given. (This only makes statistical sense if the models
are nested.)  It is conventional to list the models from smallest
to largest, but this is up to the user.
</p>
<p>The table will contain test statistics (and P values) comparing
the reduction in deviance for the row to the
residuals.  Only a comparison of models or
contributions of their components by the chi-squared test has
been implemented.
</p>
<p>The comparison between two or more models by <code>anova</code> or
<code>anova.ndlClassifylist</code> will only be valid if they are
fitted to the same dataset. If <code>anova.ndlClassifylist</code>
detects this, it will stop and report an error.
</p>

<p>An object of class <code>"anova"</code> inheriting from class
<code>"data.frame"</code>.
