Instructions for installing ffmpeg on various platforms
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The animation package uses ffmpeg to export movies into video formats. This internal function doesn't actually install the ffmpeg library, it just gives instructions on how to do the installation – which really just point to these docs. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">install.ffmpeg()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Here are some all-too-brief instructions for the various platforms. After you have installed FFmpeg on your system, you can verify that R knows where to find it by typing <code>Sys.which('ffmpeg')</code> in the R terminal. You many need to first restart R after the install. 
</p>


<h4>Installing in Windows</h4>


<ul>
<li>
<p> Download the recent 'static' build from  <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html">https://ffmpeg.org/download.html</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Downloads are compressed with 7zip, so you may need to first install a 7zip decompression program before you can unpack the installer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Decompress the package and store contents on your computer (probably in Program Files)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Edit your system path variable to include the path to the directory containing ffmpeg.exe
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Installing on a Mac</h4>


<ul>
<li>
<p> Download most recent build from https://www.evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The binary files are compressed with 7zip so may need to install an unarchiving utility: <a href="https://theunarchiver.com/">https://theunarchiver.com/</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Copy ffmpeg to /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Installing in Linux/Unix (ffmpeg or avconv)</h4>


<ul>
<li>
<p> FFmpeg is a standard package on many linux systems.  You can check if it is installed with a command like <code>dpkg -s ffmpeg</code>. If it is not installed, you should be able to install with your system's package manager.  i.e. <code>sudo apt-get install ffmpeg</code>  or search 'ffmpeg' in the Software Center on Ubuntu.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Ubuntu and Debian systems may use an alternate program named "avconv" which can be installed with <code>sudo apt-get install libav-tools</code> or by searching 'libav-tools' in Ubuntu's Software Center. Verify that R knows where to find it by typing ‘Sys.which(’avconv')' in the R terminal. You many need to first restart R after the install. The <code>animation</code> library should automatically use 'avconv' if it sees it instead of 'ffmpeg'. If it doesn't, you can tell it to by typing <code>ani.options(ffmpeg='avconv')</code> in your R session
</p>
</li>
</ul>
