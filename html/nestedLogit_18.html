<h2>Choice of Health Insurance Product</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A company recently introduced a new health insurance provider for
its employees. At the beginning of the year the employees had to choose one of
three (or four) different health plan products from this provider to best suit
their needs.
</p>
<p>This dataset was modified from its original source (McNulty, 2022) for the
present purposes by adding a fourth choice, sampled randomly from the original three.
