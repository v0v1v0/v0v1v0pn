<h2>Matthews correlation coefficient</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) which is in essence a
correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted binary
classifications. It has also been generalised to multi-class classification.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mcc(cm)

mcc_multi(cm)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cm</code></td>
<td>
<p>A contingency table or matrix of predicted vs observed classes with
reference classes in columns and predicted classes in rows.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Use <code>mcc()</code> for 2x2 tables (binary classification). <code>mcc_multi()</code> is
for multi-class classification with k x k tables and is calculated using
Gorodkin's method.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a value between -1 and +1. A coefficient of +1
represents a perfect prediction, 0 no better than random prediction and -1
indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation.
