<h2>Reciprocity correlation coefficient</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Reciprocity correlation coefficient
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">reciprocity_cor(g)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>g</code></td>
<td>
<p>igraph object. should be a directed graph</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The usual definition of reciprocity has some defects. It cannot tell the relative difference of reciprocity compared with purely random network with the same number of vertices and edges.
The useful information from reciprocity is not the value itself, but whether mutual links occur more or less often than expected by chance.
</p>
<p>To overcome this issue, reciprocity can be defined as the correlation coefficient between the entries of the adjacency matrix of a directed graph:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
 \frac{\sum_{i\neq j} (a_{ij} - a')((a_{ji} - a')}{\sum_{i\neq j} (a_{ij} - a')^2}
</code>
</p>

<p>where a' is the density of g.
</p>
<p>This definition gives an absolute quantity which directly allows one to distinguish between reciprocal (&gt;0) and antireciprocal (&lt; 0) networks, with mutual links occurring more and less often than random respectively.
