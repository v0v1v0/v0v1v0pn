<h2>Indirect relations in a network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Derive indirect relations for a given network.
Observed relations, like presents or absence of a relation, are commonly not the center
of analysis, but are transformed in a new set of indirect relation like shortest path
distances among nodes. These transformations are usually an implicit step when centrality
indices are used. Making this step explicit gives more possibilities, for example
calculating partial centrality rankings with positional_dominance.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>type</code> parameter has the following options.
</p>
<p><em>'adjacency'</em> returns the adjacency matrix of the network.
</p>
<p><em>'weights'</em> returns the weighted adjacency matrix of the network if an edge
attribute 'weight' is present.
</p>
<p><em>'dist_sp'</em> returns shortest path distances between all pairs of nodes.
</p>
<p><em>'depend_sp'</em> returns dyadic dependencies
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\delta(u,s) = \sum_{t \in V} \frac{\sigma(s,t|u)}{\sigma(s,t)}</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">\sigma(s,t|u)</code> is the number of shortest paths from s to t that include u and
<code class="reqn">\sigma(s,t)</code> is the total number of shortest (s,t)-paths. This relation is used
for betweenness-like centrality indices.
</p>
<p><em>'walks'</em> returns walk counts between pairs of nodes, usually they are
weighted decreasingly in their lengths or other properties which can be done by adding
a function in <code>FUN</code>.  See transform_relations for options.
</p>
<p><em>'dist_resist'</em> returns the resistance distance between all pairs of nodes.
</p>
<p><em>'dist_lf'</em> returns a logarithmic forest distance <code class="reqn">d_\alpha(s,t)</code>. The logarithmic forest
distances form a one-parametric family of distances, converging to shortest path distances as <code class="reqn">\alpha -&gt; 0</code>
and to the resistance distance as <code class="reqn">\alpha -&gt; \infty</code>. See (Chebotarev, 2011) for more details.
The parameter <code>lfparam</code> can be used to tune <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>.
</p>
<p><em>'dist_walk'</em> returns the walk distance <code class="reqn">d_\alpha^W(s,t)</code> between nodes. The walk distances form a one-parametric
family of distances, converging to shortest path distances as <code class="reqn">\alpha -&gt; 0</code> and to longest
walk distances for <code class="reqn">\alpha -&gt; \infty</code>. Walk distances contain the logarithmic forest
distances as a special case. See (Chebotarev, 2012) for more details.
</p>
<p><em>'dist_rwalk'</em> returns the expected length of a random walk between two nodes. For more
details see (Noh and Rieger, 2004)
</p>
<p><em>'depend_netflow'</em> returns dependencies based on network flow (See Freeman et al.,1991).
If <code>netflowmode="raw"</code>, the function returns
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\delta(u,s) = \sum_{t \in V} f(s,t,G)-f(s,t,G-v)</code>
</p>

<p>where f(s,t,G) is the maximum flow from s to t in G and f(s,t,G-v) in G without the node v.
For <code>netflowmode="frac"</code> it returns dependencies in the form, similar to shortest path dependencies:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\delta(u,s) = \sum_{t \in V} \frac{f(s,t,G)-f(s,t,G-v)}{f(s,t,G)}</code>
</p>

<p><em>'depend_curflow'</em> returns pairwise dependencies based on current flow. The relation is
based on the same idea as 'depend_sp' and 'depend_netflow'. However, instead of considering
shortest paths or network flow, the current flow (or equivalent: random walks) between nodes
are of interest. See (Newman, 2005) for details.
</p>
<p><em>'depend_exp'</em> returns pairwise dependencies based on 'communicability':
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\delta(u,s)=\sum_{t \in V} \frac{exp(A)_{st}-exp(A+E(u))_{st}}{exp(A)_{st}},</code>
</p>

<p>where E(u) has nonzeros only in row and column u, and
in this row and column has -1 if A has +1. See (Estrada et al., 2009) for additional details.
</p>
<p><em>'depend_rsps'</em>. Simple randomized shortest path dependencies.
The simple RSP dependency of a node u with respect to absorbing paths from s to t,
is defined as the expected number of visits through u over all s-t-walks. The
parameter <code>rspxparam</code> is the "inverse temperature parameter".
If it converges to infinity, only shortest paths are considered and the expected
number of visits to a node on a shortest path approaches the probability of
following that particular path. When the parameter converges to zero, then the
dependencies converge to the expected number of visits to a node over all absorbing
walks with respect to the unbiased random walk probabilities. This means for undirected networks,
that the relations converge to adjacency. See (Kivim채ki et al., 2016) for details.
</p>
<p><em>'depend_rspn'</em> Net randomized shortest path dependencies.
The parameter <code>rspxparam</code> is the "inverse temperature parameter". The asymptotic
for the infinity case are the same as for 'depend_rsps'. If the parameter approaches zero, then
it converges to 'depend_curflow'. The net randomized shortest path dependencies
are closely related to the random walk interpretation of current flows.
See (Kivim채ki et al., 2016) for technical details.
</p>
<p>The function <code>FUN</code> is used to transform the indirect
relation. See transform_relations for predefined functions and additional help.
