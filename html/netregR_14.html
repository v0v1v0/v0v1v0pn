<h2>Social interaction data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A synthetic data set of standardized, directed interactions between 25 students in a seventh grade class.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data set with four variables. Includes the true parameters.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>interactions</dt>
<dd>
<p>25 x 25 x 5 numeric array of directed relations</p>
</dd>
<dt>xbinary</dt>
<dd>
<p>25 x 25 x 5 numeric array of  binary indictors</p>
</dd>
<dt>xabs</dt>
<dd>
<p>25 x 25 x 5 numeric array of standardized absolute difference in indicated interest in each subject area</p>
</dd>
<dt>betatrue</dt>
<dd>
<p>Numeric vector of length 7 that contains true coefficients. The first two (value 1) pertain to <code>shared_project</code> and <code>grade_difference_abs</code>. The last three are separate intercepts for each observation of the network.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Omegatrue</dt>
<dd>
<p>3000 x 3000 numeric matrix: the true covariance matrix of the errors.</p>
</dd>
<dt>phitrue</dt>
<dd>
<p>2x6 numeric matrix: true parameters of covariance matrix.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>We generated a symthetic data set form a true linear model with jointly exchangeable errors. The interactions (the outcomes) between 25 students represent normalized, directed relations between them in 5 different contexts (texts). The observation could be, for instance, the standardized number of characters texted from one student to another over a month pertaining to five subjects: school, friends, family, significant others, and popular culture. The first covariate, <code>xbinary</code>, indicates whether both students indicated in a survey that they were interested in each topic. The second covariate, <code>xabs</code>, measures the absolute, standardized difference in number of characters in total texts of each student of each subject area.
