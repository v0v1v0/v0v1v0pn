<h2>Association Graphs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Draws association graphs (graphical models) based on joint entropy values
to detect and visualize different dependence structures among the variables in the dataframe.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">assoc_graph(dat, cutoff = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dat</code></td>
<td>
<p>dataframe with rows as observations and columns as variables. Variables must all be observed or transformed categorical with finite range spaces.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cutoff</code></td>
<td>
<p>the cutoff point for the edges to be drawn based on joint entropies. Default is 0 and draws all edges.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Draws association graphs based on given thresholds of joint entropy values
between pairs of variables represented as nodes. Thickness of edges between pairs of nodes/variables
indicates the strength of dependence between them. Isolated nodes are completely
independent and paths through certain nodes/variables indicate conditional dependencies.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A ggraph object with nodes representing all variables in <code>dat</code> and edges
representing (the strength of) associations between them based on joint entropies.

# 1. categorize variables 'years' and 'age' based on
# approximately three equally size groups (values based on cdf)
# 2. make sure all outcomes start from the value 0 (optional)
# 3. remove variable 'senior' as it consists of only unique values (thus redundant)
