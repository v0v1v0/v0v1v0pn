<h2>White's data on Effective Kinship Networks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data is taken from Freeman (1978) who uses data from White (1975) to
illustrate the segregation measure.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">WhiteKinship
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Object of class "igraph" with an undirected network of size 10. Vertex
attribute <code>gender</code>, takes values "male" or "female".
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Based on Freeman (1978):
</p>
<p>White dealt with the problem of segregation among social positions rather
than among individual persons. He specified a set of standard kinship
positions that he called the “effective kinship network”.
</p>
<p>Traditional analysis (e.g. Murdock, 1971) have argued that societies
sometimes proscribe interaction among some kinship positions as an extension
of icest taboos.  Thus, given this reasoning, kinship positions should be
segregated according to the gender of their occupants. White's data provide
possibility to test of this hypothesis.
</p>
<p>White collected data on the rules governing various kinds of interaction
among occupants of his ten standard kinship positions for a sample of 219
societies.  For every pair of positions White specified whether or not
interaction between their occupants was ever restricted in any society in
the sample.
