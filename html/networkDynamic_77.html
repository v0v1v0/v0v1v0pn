<h2>Newcomb's Fraternity Networks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These 14 networks record weekly sociometric preference rankings
from 17 men attending the University of Michigan in the fall
of 1956; Data were collected longitudinally over 15 weeks,
although data from week 9 are missing.
</p>
<p>The men were recruited to live in off-campus (fraternity)
housing, rented for them as part of the Michigan Group Study
Project supervised by Theodore Newcomb from 1953 to 1956. All
were incoming transfer students with no prior acquaintance of
one another.
</p>
<p>The data set contains two longitudinal networks as <code>network.list</code>.
</p>
<p><code>newcomb.rank</code> is a
<code>network.list</code> object with 14 networks. Each network is complete and the
edge value <code>rank</code> is the preference of the <code class="reqn">i</code>th men for the <code class="reqn">j</code>th
man from <code>1</code> through <code>16</code>.  A <code>1</code> indicates first 
preference, and no ties were allowed.
</p>
<p><code>newcomb</code> is a <code>network.list</code> object that has binary
edge values but is similar in structure to <code>newcomb.rank</code>
and derived from it. Each network has a tie from the <code class="reqn">i</code>th
men to the <code class="reqn">j</code>th man if <code class="reqn">i</code> had a preference for
<code class="reqn">j</code> of 8 or less. Otherwise there is not tie from <code class="reqn">i</code>
to <code class="reqn">j</code>. Note that since these are ranks, the degree of each vertex (and the total number of edges) does not vary over time
