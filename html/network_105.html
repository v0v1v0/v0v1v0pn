<h2>Examples of how to load vertex and edge attributes into networks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Additional examples of how to manipulate network attributes using the
functions documented in <code>attribute.methods</code>
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>attribute.methods</code> documentation gives details about the
use of the specific network attribute methods such as
<code>get.vertex.attribute</code> and <code>set.edge.attribute</code>.  This document
gives examples of how to load in and attach attribute data, drawing heavily
on material from the Sunbelt statnet workshops
<a href="https://statnet.org/workshops/">https://statnet.org/workshops/</a>.
</p>
<p>The examples section below give a quick overview of:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Loading in a matrix
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Attaching vertex attributes
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Attaching edge atributes from a matrix
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Loading in an edgelist
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Attaching edge atributes from an edgelist
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>read.table</code> documentation provides more information about
reading data in from various tabular file formats prior to loading into a
network.  Note that the output is usually a <code>data.frame</code> object
in which each columns is represented as a <code>factor</code>.  This means
that in some cases when the output is directly loaded into a network the
variable values will appear as factor level numbers instead of text values.
The <code>stringsAsFactors=FALSE</code> flag may help with this, but some columns
may need to be converted using <code>as.numeric</code> or <code>as.character</code>
where appropriate.

# read in a relational data adjacency matrix

# LOADING IN A MATRIX
## Not run: 
# can download matrix file from 
# https://statnet.csde.washington.edu/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Resources/relationalData.csv
# and download vertex attribute file from
# https://statnet.csde.washington.edu/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Resources/vertexAttributes.csv

# load in relation matrix from file
relations &lt;- read.csv("relationalData.csv",header=FALSE,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# convert to matrix format from data frame
relations &lt;- as.matrix(relations) 

# load in vertex attributes
nodeInfo &lt;- read.csv("vertexAttributes.csv",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

## End(Not run)
          
                  
print(relations) # peek at matrix 
print(nodeInfo)  # peek at attribute data

# Since our relational data has no row/column names, let's set them now
rownames(relations) &lt;- nodeInfo$name
colnames(relations) &lt;- nodeInfo$name

# create undirected network object from matrix
nrelations&lt;-network(relations,directed=FALSE)

# it read in vertex names from matrix col names ...
network.vertex.names(nrelations)

# ATTACHING VERTEX ATTRIBUTES

# ... but could also set vertex.names with 
nrelations%v%'vertex.names'&lt;- nodeInfo$name

# load in other attributes 
nrelations%v%"age" &lt;- nodeInfo$age
nrelations%v%"sex" &lt;- nodeInfo$sex
nrelations%v%"handed" &lt;- nodeInfo$handed
nrelations%v%"lastDocVisit" &lt;- nodeInfo$lastDocVisit

# Note: order of attributes in the data frame MUST match vertex ids
# otherwise the attribute will get assigned to the wrong vertex

# check that they got loaded
list.vertex.attributes(nrelations)


# what if we had an adjaceny  matrix like:
valuedMat&lt;-matrix(c(1,2,3, 2,0,9.5,1,5,0),ncol=3,byrow=TRUE)
valuedMat

# make a network from it
valuedNet&lt;-network(valuedMat,loops=TRUE,directed=TRUE)

# print it back out ...
as.matrix(valuedNet)

# wait, where did the values go!!?

# LOADING A MATRIX WITH VALUES

# to construct net from matrix with values:
valuedNet&lt;-network(valuedMat,loops=TRUE,directed=TRUE,
            ignore.eval=FALSE,names.eval='myEdgeWeight')
            
# also have to specify the name of the attribute when converting to matrix
as.matrix(valuedNet,attrname='myEdgeWeight')

# ATTACHING EDGE ATTRIBUTES FROM A MATRIX

# maybe we have edge attributes of a different sort in another matrix like:
edgeAttrs&lt;-matrix(c("B","Z","Q","W","A","E","L","P","A"),ncol=3,byrow=TRUE)
edgeAttrs

# we can still attach them
valuedNet&lt;-set.edge.value(valuedNet,'someLetters',edgeAttrs)

# and extract them
as.matrix(valuedNet,attrname='someLetters')
valuedNet%e%'someLetters'

# but notice that some of the values didn't get used 
# the ("A"s are missing) because there were no corresponding edges (loops)
# for the attribute to be attached to


# ATTACHING EDGE ATTRIBUTES FROM A LIST

# it is also possible to attach edge attributes directly from a list
edgeCols&lt;-c("red","green","blue","orange","pink","brown","gray")
valuedNet&lt;-set.edge.attribute(valuedNet,"edgeColors",edgeCols)

# but this can be risky, because we may not know the ordering of the edges,
# (especially if some have been deleted).  Does "green" go with the edge from 
# 1 to 2, or from 3 to 1?

# Usually if the edge data is only availible in list form, it is safer to construct
# the network from an edgelist in the first place

# LOADING IN AN EDGELIST

# pretend we just loaded in this data.frame from a file
elData&lt;-data.frame(
  from_id=c("1","2","3","1","3","1","2"),
  to_id=c("1", "1", "1", "2", "2", "3", "3"),
  myEdgeWeight=c(1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 3, 9.5),
  someLetters=c("B", "W", "L", "Z", "P", "Q", "E"),
  edgeCols=c("red","green","blue","orange","pink","brown","gray"),
  stringsAsFactors=FALSE
)

# peek at data
# each row corresponds to a relationship (edge) in the network
elData

# to make a network we just use the first two id columns
valuedNet2&lt;-network(elData[,1:2],loops=TRUE)

# print it out
as.matrix(valuedNet2)

# has right edges, but no values

# to include values (with names from the columns)

valuedNet2&lt;-network(elData,loops=TRUE)
list.edge.attributes(valuedNet2)
as.matrix(valuedNet2,attrname='someLetters')
