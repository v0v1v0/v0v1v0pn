<h2>Identifying and Counting Missing Edges in a Network Object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>network.naedgecount</code> returns the number of edges within a
<code>network</code> object which are flagged as missing.  The <code>is.na</code>
network method returns a new network containing the missing edges.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'network'
is.na(x)

network.naedgecount(x, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>network</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>additional arguments, not used</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The missingness of an edge is controlled by its <code>na</code> attribute (which
is mandatory for all edges); <code>network.naedgecount</code> returns the number
of edges for which <code>na==TRUE</code>.  The <code>is.na</code> network method
produces a new network object whose edges correspond to the missing
(<code>na==TRUE</code>) edges of the original object, and is thus a covenient
method of extracting detailed missingness information on the entire network.
The network returned by <code>is.na</code> is guaranteed to have the same base
network attributes (directedness, loopness, hypergraphicity, multiplexity,
and bipartite constraint) as the original network object, but no other
information is copied; note too that edge IDs are <em>not</em> preserved by
this process (although adjacency obviously is).  Since the resulting object
is a <code>network</code>, standard coercion, print/summary, and other
methods can be applied to it in the usual fashion.
</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind that “missingness” in the sense used here
reflects the assertion that an edge's presence or absence is unknown,
<em>not</em> that said edge is known not to be present.  Thus, the <code>na</code>
count for an empty graph is properly 0, since all edges are known to be
absent.  Edges can be flagged as missing by setting their <code>na</code>
attribute to <code>TRUE</code> using <code>set.edge.attribute</code>, or by
appropriate use of the network assignment operators; see below for an
example of the latter.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>is.na(x)</code> returns a network object, and
<code>network.naedgecount(x)</code> returns the number of missing edges.

<pre><code class="language-R">
#Create an empty network with no missing data

#Now, add some missing edges

g[,]                        #Observe the missing elements

network.naedgecount(g)==4   #These elements do count!
