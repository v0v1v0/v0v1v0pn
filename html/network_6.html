<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These operators allow for algebraic manipulation of relational structures.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'network'
e1 + e2

## S3 method for class 'network'
e1 - e2

## S3 method for class 'network'
e1 * e2

## S3 method for class 'network'
!e1

## S3 method for class 'network'
e1 | e2

## S3 method for class 'network'
e1 &amp; e2

## S3 method for class 'network'
e1 %c% e2
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>e1</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>network</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In general, the binary network operators function by producing a new network
object whose edge structure is based on that of the input networks.  The
properties of the new structure depend upon the inputs as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The size of the new network is equal to the size of the input networks
(for all operators save <code>%c%</code>), which must themselves be of equal size.
Likewise, the <code>bipartite</code> attributes of the inputs must match, and this
is preserved in the output.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If either input network allows loops,
multiplex edges, or hyperedges, the output acquires this property.  (If both
input networks do not allow these features, then the features are disallowed
in the output network.)  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If either input network is directed, the
output is directed; if exactly one input network is directed, the undirected
input is treated as if it were a directed network in which all edges are
reciprocated.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Supplemental attributes (including vertex names, but
not edgwise missingness) are not transferred to the output.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> The unary
operator acts per the above, but with a single input.  Thus, the output
network has the same properties as the input, with the exception of
supplemental attributes.
</p>
<p>The behavior of the composition operator, <code>%c%</code>, is somewhat more
complex than the others.  In particular, it will return a bipartite network
whenever either input network is bipartite <em>or</em> the vertex names of the
two input networks do not match (or are missing).  If both inputs are
non-bipartite and have identical vertex names, the return value will have
the same structure (but with loops).  This behavior corresponds to the
interpretation of the composition operator as counting walks on labeled sets
of vertices.
</p>
<p>Hypergraphs are not yet supported by these routines, but ultimately will be
(as suggested by the above).
</p>
<p>The specific operations carried out by these operators are generally
self-explanatory in the non-multiplex case, but semantics in the latter
circumstance bear elaboration.  The following summarizes the behavior of
each operator:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>+</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>An <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edge is created in
the return graph for every <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edge in each of the input graphs.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>An <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edge is created in the return graph for
every <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edge in the first input that is not matched by an
<code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edge in the second input; if the second input has more
<code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edges than the first, no <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edges are created in the
return graph.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>*</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>An <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edge is created for every
pairing of <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edges in the respective input graphs.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>%c%</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>An <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edge is created in the return graph for
every edge pair <code class="reqn">(i,k),(k,j)</code> with the first edge in the first input and
the second edge in the second input.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>!</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>An <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edge
is created in the return graph for every <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> in the input not having
an edge.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>|</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>An <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edge is created in the return
graph if either input contains an <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edge.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>&amp;</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>An
<code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edge is created in the return graph if both inputs contain an
<code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edge.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Semantics for missing-edge cases follow from the above,
under the interpretation that edges with <code>na==TRUE</code> are viewed as
having an unknown state.  Thus, for instance, <code>x*y</code> with <code>x</code>
having 2 <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> non-missing and 1 missing edge and <code>y</code> having 3
respective non-missing and 2 missing edges will yield an output network with
6 non-missing and 9 missing <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> edges.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The resulting network.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Currently, there is a naming conflict between the composition operator
and the <code>%c%</code> operator in the <code>sna</code> package.  This
will be resolved in future releases; for the time being, one can determine
which version of <code>%c%</code> is in use by varying which package is loaded
first.
