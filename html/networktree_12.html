<h3>Format</h3>

<p>a dataframe. Columns represent questionnaire items and rows represent individuals
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Ten Item Personality Questionnaire (TIPI) is a brief inventory of the Big 
Five personality domains. Each personality domain is assessed with two 
items. One item measures the domain normally and the other item measures 
the domain in reverse (e.g., "reserved, quiet" for reverse extraversion).
</p>
<p>Labels for TIPI items in this dataset correspond to the first letter of 
each Big Five personality domain (Extraversion, Neuroticism, 
Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Openness to experience), 
with the character “r” indicating items that measure the domain 
in reverse.
</p>
<p>Also includes demographics such as education level, 
rearing environment (urban/suburban/rural), gender, 
English as a native language, age, religion, sexual orientation, 
race, voting status, marriage status, and number of children 
in one's family during childhood.
