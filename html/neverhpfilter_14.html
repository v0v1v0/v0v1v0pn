<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>This time series is an interpretation of US Business Cycle Expansions
and Contractions data provided by The National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER) at <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html</a>. Our
time series is composed of dummy variables that represent periods of
expansion and recession. The NBER identifies months and quarters of
turning points without designating a date within the period that
turning points occurred. The dummy variable adopts an arbitrary
convention that the turning point occurred at a specific date within
the period. The arbitrary convention does not reflect any judgment on
this issue by the NBER's Business Cycle Dating Committee. A value of 1
is a recessionary period, while a value of 0 is an expansionary
period. For this time series, the recession begins the first day of
the period following a peak and ends on the last day of the period of
the trough. For more options on recession shading, see the notes and
links below.
</p>
<p>The recession shading data that we provide initially comes from the
source as a list of dates that are either an economic peak or trough.
We interpret dates into recession shading data using one of three
arbitrary methods. All of our recession shading data is available
using all three interpretations. The period between a peak and trough
is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are collectively
extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually
and collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or
in part. In situations where a portion of a period is included in the
recession, the whole period is deemed to be included in the recession
period.
</p>
<p>The first interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a
recession from the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the
trough for monthly and quarterly data. For daily data, the recession
begins on the 15th of the month of the peak and ends on the 15th of
the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly
data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire peak and trough
periods are included in the recession shading. This method shows the
maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly
data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its
own publications. A version of this time series represented using the
midpoint method can be found at:

</p>
<p>The second interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a
recession from the period following the peak through the trough (i.e.
the peak is not included in the recession shading, but the trough is).
For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the first
month following the peak and ends on the last day of the month of the
trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. The trough
method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs. The trough method
is used for this series.
</p>
<p>The third interpretation, known as the peak method, is to show a
recession from the period of the peak to the trough (i.e. the peak is
included in the recession shading, but the trough is not). For daily
data, the recession begins on the first day of the month of the peak
and ends on the last day of the month preceding the trough. Daily data
is a disaggregation of monthly data. A version of this time series
represented using the peak method can be found at:
