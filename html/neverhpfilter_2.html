<p>The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions 
trade federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other 
overnight. When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve 
account, it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler terms, 
a bank with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend 
to another bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. (1) The rate that the borrowing
institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the
two banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of 
negotiations is called the effective federal funds rate.(2) The
effective federal funds rate is essentially determined by the market
but is influenced by the Federal Reserve through open market
operations to reach the federal funds rate target.(2)
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to
determine the federal funds target rate. As previously stated, this
rate influences the effective federal funds rate through open market
operations or by buying and selling of government bonds (government debt).
(2) More specifically, the Federal Reserve decreases liquidity
by selling government bonds, thereby raising the federal funds rate
because banks have less liquidity to trade with other banks.
Similarly, the Federal Reserve can increase liquidity by buying
government bonds, decreasing the federal funds rate because banks have
excess liquidity for trade. Whether the Federal Reserve wants to buy
or sell bonds depends on the state of the economy. If the FOMC
believes the economy is growing too fast and inflation pressures are
inconsistent with the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, the
Committee may set a higher federal funds rate target to temper
economic activity. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may set a lower
federal funds rate target to spur greater economic activity.
Therefore, the FOMC must observe the current state of the economy to
determine the best course of monetary policy that will maximize
economic growth while adhering to the dual mandate set forth by
Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC considers
a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices and wages,
employment, consumer spending and income, business investments, and
foreign exchange markets.

<p>The federal funds rate is the central interest rate in the U.S.
financial market. It influences other interest rates such as the prime
rate, which is the rate banks charge their customers with higher
credit ratings. Additionally, the federal funds rate indirectly
influences longer- term interest rates such as mortgages, loans, and
savings, all of which are very important to consumer wealth and confidence.(2)
