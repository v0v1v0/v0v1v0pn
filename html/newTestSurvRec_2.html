<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The patients included in the study have been operated between January 1996 and December 1998. For each patient, we have considered this date as the beginning of the observational period. All patients were followed until June 2002. Consequently, the length of the monitoring period can differ for each patient, depending on its surgery date. The first inter occurrence time has been considered as the time between the surgical intervention and the first hospitalization related to cancer. Four hundred and three patients with colon and rectum cancer have been included in the study. Information about their sex (male or female), age ( 60, 60-74 or  75), and tumor stage using Dukes classification (A-B, C, or D) have been recorded. The following inter- occurrence times have been considered as the difference between the last hospitalization and the current one. Only re-admissions related to cancer have been considered.</p>
