<h2>ngram: Fast n-Gram Tokenization</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An n-gram is a sequence of n "words" taken from a
body of text.  This package offers utilities for creating, 
displaying, summarizing, and "babbling" n-grams.  The 
tokenization and "babbling" are handled by very efficient C
code, which can even be build as its own standalone library.
The babbler is a simple Markov chain.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The ngram package is distributed under the permissive 2-clause BSD license.
If you find the code here useful, please let us know and/or cite the
package, whatever is appropriate.
</p>
<p>The package has its own PRNG; we use an implementation of MT1997 for all
non-deterministic choices.
