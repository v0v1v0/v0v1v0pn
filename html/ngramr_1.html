<h2>ngramr: Dig into the Google Ngram Viewer using R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://books.google.com/ngrams">Google Books Ngram Viewer</a>
allows you to enter a list of phrases and then displays a graph showing
how often the phrases have occurred in a corpus of books
(e.g., "British English", "English Fiction", "French") over time.
The underlying data is hidden in web page, embedded in some Javascript.
</p>
<p>This package extracts the data an provides it in the form of an R dataframe.
</p>
<p>The key function is <code>ngram</code> which, given a collection of
phrases, returns a dataframe containing the frequencies by year.
</p>
<p>The code is based on the <code>getNgrams.py</code> Python script available on
<a href="http://www.culturomics.org/Resources/get-ngrams">Culturomics Code</a>
written by Jean-Baptiste Michel. The
<a href="http://www.culturomics.org/home">Culturomics</a>
website itself is worth exploring.
</p>
<p>Note that compared to the 2009 versions, the 2012 and 2019 versions have
larger numbers of books, improved OCR, improved library and publisher
metadata. The 2012 and 2019 corpuses also don't form ngrams that cross
sentence boundaries, and do form ngrams across page boundaries and
support part of speech tagging, unlike the 2009 versions.
</p>
<p>Like the Google Ngram Viewer website itself, this package is aimed at for
quick inquiries into the usage of small sets of phrases.
</p>
<p>Please respect the terms of service of the Google Books Ngram Viewer while
using this code. This code is meant to help viewers retrieve data behind
a few queries, not bang at Google's  servers with dozens of queries.
