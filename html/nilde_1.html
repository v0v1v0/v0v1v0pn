<h2>
Nonnegative Integer Solutions of Linear Diophantine Equations
with Applications
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>nilde</code> provides functions for enumerating all existing nonnegative integer solutions of a linear Diophantine equation. The package also includes functions for solving 0-1, bounded and unbounded knapsack problems; 0-1, bounded and unbounded subset sum problems; and a problem of additive partitioning of natural numbers. The algorithm is based on a generating function of Hardy and Littlewood used by Voinov and Nikulin (1997).
