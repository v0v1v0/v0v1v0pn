<h2>Turn a numeric vector into a single-row or single-column matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Turns a numeric vector into a matrix that has 1 row or 1 column.  Part of NIMBLE language.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">asRow(x)

asCol(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric to be turned into a single row or column matrix</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the NIMBLE language, some automatic determination of how to turn vectors into single-row or single-column matrices is done.
For example, in <code>A %*% x</code>, where A is a matrix and x a vector, x will be turned into a single-column matrix unless
it is known at compile time that A is a single column, in which case x will be turned into a single-row matrix.
However, if it is desired that x be turned into a single row but A cannot be determined at compile time to be a single column,
then one can use <code>A %*% asRow(x)</code> to force this conversion.
