<h2>Information on model structure used for derivatives</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Inspect structure of a nimble model to determine nodes needed as "update"
and/or "constant" entries in usage of nimDerivs. This will typically be used
in the setup code of a nimbleFunction.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">makeModelDerivsInfo(model, wrtNodes, calcNodes, dataAsConstantNodes = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>a nimble model object, such as returned from <code>nimbleModel</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>wrtNodes</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector of node names in the model with respect to
which derivatives will be taken through a call to <code>nimDerivs</code> (same as
<code>derivs</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>calcNodes</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector of node names in the model that will be
used in <code>model$calculate(calcNodes)</code> while derivatives are being
recorded.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dataAsConstantNodes</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating whether data nodes in the model
should automatically be treated as "constant" entries (TRUE) or "update"
entries (FALSE). Defaults to TRUE.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the compilable parts of a <code>nimbleFunction</code> (i.e. <code>run</code>
or other method code, not <code>setup</code> code), a call like
<code>nimDerivs(foo(x), ...)</code> records derivatives of <code>foo(x)</code>. If
<code>foo</code> contains any calls to <code>model$calculate(calcNodes)</code>, it may
be necessary to provide auxiliary information about the model in further
arguments to <code>nimDerivs</code>, specifically the <code>model</code>,
<code>updateNodes</code> and <code>constantNodes</code> arguments.
'makeModelDerivsInfo' is a utility to set up that information for typical
use cases. It returns a list with elements <code>updateNodes</code> and
<code>constantNodes</code> to be passed as arguments of the same name to
<code>nimDerivs</code> (along with passing the <code>model</code> as the <code>model</code>
argument).
</p>
<p>The reason auxiliary information is needed is that recording of derivatives
uses a different model than for regular calculations. Together,
<code>updateNodes</code> and <code>constantNodes</code> should contain all nodes whose
values are needed for the model calculations being recorded and that are not
part of <code>wrtNodes</code>. These may include parents of nodes that are in
<code>calcNodes</code> but are not themselves in <code>calcNodes</code>, as well as the
values of stochastic nodes in <code>calcNodes</code>, which are needed to calculate
the corresponding log probabilities. <code>updateNodes</code> will have their
values updated from the regular model every time that recorded derivative
calculations are used. <code>constantNodes</code> will not be updated every time,
which means their values will be permanently fixed either the first time the
call to 'nimDerivs' is invoked or on any subsequent call that has
<code>reset=TRUE</code>. Use of <code>constantNodes</code> can be slightly more
efficient, but one must be careful to be aware that values will not be
updated unless <code>reset=TRUE</code>. See the automatic differentiation section
of the User Manual for more information.
</p>
<p>In the above explanation, care must be taken to understand what should be
included in <code>wrtNodes</code>. In a typical use case, some arguments to
<code>foo</code> are put into the model using <code>values(model, nodes) &lt;-
some_foo_arguments</code>. Next there is typically a call to
<code>model$calculate(calcNodes)</code>. Here the <code>nodes</code> are considered
"with-respect-to" nodes because derivative tracking will follow the arguments
of <code>foo</code>, including when they are put into a model and hence used in
<code>model$calculate</code>. Therefore these <code>nodes</code> should be the
<code>wrtNodes</code> for <code>makeModelDerivsInfo</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with elements <code>updateNodes</code> and <code>constantNodes</code>.
These shouls be provided as the same-named arguments to <code>nimDerivs</code>
(same as <code>derivs</code>).
</p>
<p>When using double-taping of derivatives (i.e. <code>foo</code> contains another
call to <code>nimDerivs</code>), both calls to <code>nimDerivs</code> should include the
<code>model</code>, <code>updateNodes</code>, and <code>constantNodes</code> arguments.
