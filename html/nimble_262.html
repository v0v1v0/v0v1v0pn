<h2>Information on initial values in a NIMBLE model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Having uninitialized nodes in a NIMBLE model can potentially cause some algorithms to fail and can lead to poor performance in others.  Here are some
general guidelines on how non-initialized variables can affect performance:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> MCMC will auto-initialize but will do so from the prior distribution.  This can cause slow convergence, especially in the case of diffuse priors.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Likewise, particle filtering methods will initialize top-level parameters from their prior distributions, which can lead to errors or poor performance in these methods.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see this Section (<a href="https://r-nimble.org/html_manual/cha-mcmc.html#sec:initMCMC">https://r-nimble.org/html_manual/cha-mcmc.html#sec:initMCMC</a>) of the NIMBLE user manual for further suggestions.
