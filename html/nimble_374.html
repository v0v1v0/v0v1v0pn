<h2>Class <code>MCMCconf</code>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Objects of this class configure an MCMC algorithm, specific to a particular model.  Objects are normally created by calling <code>configureMCMC</code>.
Given an MCMCconf object, the actual MCMC function can be built by calling <code>buildMCMC(conf)</code>.
See documentation below for method initialize() for details of creating an MCMCconf object.

<dd>
<p>Adds a sampler to the list of samplers contained in the MCMCconf object.
</p>
<p>Arguments:
</p>
<p>target: The target node or nodes to be sampled.  This may be specified as a character vector of model node and/or variable names.  For univariate samplers, only a single target node should be provided (unless 'targetByNode' is TRUE).  For multivariate samplers, one instance of the multivariate sampler will be assigned to all nodes specified.  Nodes are specified in combination with the 'targetByNode' and 'multivariateNodesAsScalars' arguments.
</p>
<p>type: When 'default' is FALSE, specifies the type of sampler to add, specified as either a character string or a nimbleFunction object.  If the character argument type='newSamplerType', then either newSamplerType or sampler_newSamplerType must correspond to a nimbleFunction (i.e. a function returned by nimbleFunction, not a specialized nimbleFunction).  Alternatively, the type argument may be provided as a nimbleFunction itself rather than its name.  In that case, the 'name' argument may also be supplied to provide a meaningful name for this sampler.  The default value is 'RW' which specifies scalar adaptive Metropolis-Hastings sampling with a normal proposal distribution. This default will result in an error if 'target' specifies more than one target node (unless 'targetByNode' is TRUE).  This argument is not used when the 'default' argument is TRUE.
</p>
<p>control: An optional list of control arguments to sampler functions.  These will override those specified in the control list argument to configureMCMC.  If a control list is provided, the elements will be provided to all sampler functions which utilize the named elements given. For example, the standard Metropolis-Hastings random walk sampler (sampler_RW) utilizes control list elements 'adaptive', 'adaptInterval', 'scale'. The default values for control list arguments for samplers (if not otherwise provided as an argument to configureMCMC or addSampler) are contained in the setup code of each sampling algorithm.
</p>
<p>print: Logical argument, specifying whether to print the details of newly added sampler(s).
</p>
<p>name: Optional character string name for the sampler, which is used by the printSamplers method.  If 'name' is not provided, the 'type' argument is used to generate the sampler name.
</p>
<p>targetByNode: Logical argument, with default FALSE.  This arguments controls whether separate instances of the specified sampler 'type' should be assigned to each node contained in 'target'.  When FALSE, a single instance of sampler 'type' is assigned to operate on 'target'.  When TRUE, potentially multiple instances of sampler 'type' will be added to the MCMC configuration, operating on the distinct nodes which compose 'target'.  For example, if 'target' is a vector of distinct node names, then a separate sampler will be assigned to each node in this vector.  If 'target' is a model variable which itself is comprised of multiple distinct nodes, then a separate sampler is assigned to each node composing the 'target' variable. Additional control of the handling of multivariate nodes is provided using the 'multivariateNodesAsScalars' argument.
</p>
<p>multivariateNodesAsScalars: Logical argument, with default value FALSE.  This argument is used in two ways.  Functionally, both uses result in separate instances of samplers being added to the scalar components which compose multivariate nodes. See details below.
</p>
<p>silent: Logical argument, specifying whether to print warning messages when assigning samplers.
</p>
<p>default: Logical argument, with default value FALSE.  When FALSE, the 'type' argument dictates what sampling algorithm is assigned to the specified nodes.  When TRUE, default samplers will be assigned to the specified nodes following the same logic as the configureMCMC method, and also using the 'useConjugacy', 'onlyRW', 'onlySlice' and 'multivariateNodesAsScalars' arguments.
</p>
<p>useConjugacy: Logical argument, with default value TRUE.  If specified as FALSE, then no conjugate samplers will be used, even when a node is determined to be in a conjugate relationship.  This argument is only used when the 'default' argument is TRUE.
</p>
<p>onlyRW: Logical argument, with default value FALSE.  If specified as TRUE, then Metropolis-Hastings random walk samplers will be assigned for all non-terminal continuous-valued nodes nodes. Discrete-valued nodes are assigned a slice sampler, and terminal nodes are assigned a posterior_predictive sampler.  This argument is only used when the 'default' argument is TRUE.
</p>
<p>onlySlice: Logical argument, with default value FALSE.  If specified as TRUE, then a slice sampler is assigned for all non-terminal nodes. Terminal nodes are still assigned a posterior_predictive sampler.  This argument is only used when the 'default' argument is TRUE.
</p>
<p>allowData: Logical argument, with default value FALSE.  When FALSE, samplers will not be assigned to operate on data nodes, even if data nodes are included in 'target'.  When TRUE, samplers will be assigned to 'target' without regard to whether nodes are designated as data.
</p>
<p>...: Additional named arguments passed through ... will be used as additional control list elements.
</p>
<p>Details:
</p>
<p>Samplers are added to the end of the list of samplers for this MCMCconf object, and do not replace any existing samplers.  Samplers are removed using the removeSamplers method.
</p>
<p>Invisibly returns a list of the current sampler configurations, which are samplerConf reference class objects.
</p>
<p>'multivariateNodesAsScalars' has two usages. The first usage occurs when 'targetByNode' is TRUE and therefore separate instances of sampler 'type' are assigned to each node which compose 'target'.  In this first usage, this argument controls how multivariate nodes (those included in the 'target') are handled.  If FALSE, any multivariate nodes in 'target' have a single instance of sampler 'type' assigned.  If TRUE, any multivariate nodes appearing in 'target' are themselves decomposed into their scalar elements, and a separate instance of sampler 'type' is assigned to operate on each scalar element.
</p>
<p>The second usage of 'multivariateNodesAsScalars' occurs when 'default' is TRUE, and therefore samplers are assigned according to the default logic of configureMCMC, which is further controlled by the arguments 'useConjugacy', 'onlyRW', 'onlySlice' and 'multivariateNodesAsScalars'.  In this second usage, if 'multivariateNodesAsScalars' is TRUE, then multivariate nodes will be decomposed into their scalar components, and separate samplers assigned to each scalar element.  Note, however, that multivariate nodes appearing in conjugate relationships will still be assigned the corresponding conjugate sampler (provided 'useConjugacy' is TRUE), regardless of the value of this argument.  If 'multivariateNodesAsScalars' is FALSE, then a single multivarate sampler will be assigned to update each multivariate node.  The default value of this argument can be controlled using the nimble option 'MCMCmultivariateNodesAsScalars'.</p>

<dd>
<p>Creates a MCMC configuration for a given model.  The resulting object is suitable as an argument to buildMCMC.
</p>
<p>Arguments:
</p>
<p>model: A NIMBLE model object, created from nimbleModel(...)
</p>
<p>nodes: An optional character vector, specifying the nodes for which samplers should be created.
Nodes may be specified in their indexed form, 'y[1, 3]', or nodes specified without indexing will be expanded fully, e.g., 'x' will be expanded to 'x[1]', 'x[2]', etc.
If missing, the default value is all non-data stochastic nodes.
If NULL, then no samplers are added.
</p>
<p>control: An optional list of control arguments to sampler functions.  If a control list is provided, the elements will be provided to all sampler functions which utilize the named elements given.
For example, the standard Metropolis-Hastings random walk sampler (sampler_RW) utilizes control list elements 'adaptive', 'adaptInterval', 'scale'.
The default values for control list arguments for samplers (if not otherwise provided as an argument to configureMCMC() or addSampler()) are contained in the setup code of each sampling algorithm.
</p>
<p>monitors: A character vector of node names or variable names, to record during MCMC sampling.
This set of monitors will be recorded with thinning interval 'thin', and the samples will be stored into the 'mvSamples' object.
The default value is all top-level stochastic nodes of the model – those having no stochastic parent nodes.
</p>
<p>monitors2: A character vector of node names or variable names, to record during MCMC sampling.
This set of monitors will be recorded with thinning interval 'thin2', and the samples will be stored into the 'mvSamples2' object.
The default value is an empty character vector, i.e. no values will be recorded.
</p>
<p>thin: The thinning interval for 'monitors'.  Default value is one.
</p>
<p>thin2: The thinning interval for 'monitors2'.  Default value is one.

<p>onlySlice: A logical argument, with default value FALSE.  If specified as TRUE, then a slice sampler is assigned for all non-terminal nodes. Terminal nodes are still assigned a posterior_predictive sampler.
</p>
<p>multivariateNodesAsScalars: A logical argument, with default value FALSE.  If specified as TRUE, then non-terminal multivariate stochastic nodes will have scalar samplers assigned to each of the scalar components of the multivariate node.  The default value of FALSE results in a single block sampler assigned to the entire multivariate node.  Note, multivariate nodes appearing in conjugate relationships will be assigned the corresponding conjugate sampler (provided useConjugacy == TRUE), regardless of the value of this argument.
</p>
<p>enableWAIC: A logical argument, specifying whether to enable WAIC calculations for the resulting MCMC algorithm.  Defaults to the value of nimbleOptions('MCMCenableWAIC'), which in turn defaults to FALSE.  Setting nimbleOptions('MCMCenableWAIC' = TRUE) will ensure that WAIC is enabled for all calls to 'configureMCMC' and 'buildMCMC'.
</p>
<p>controlWAIC A named list of inputs that control the behavior of the WAIC calculation, passed as the 'control' input to 'buildWAIC'. See 'help(waic)'.

<dd>
<p>Sets the ordering in which sampler functions will execute.
</p>
<p>This allows some samplers to be "turned off", or others to execute multiple times in a single MCMC iteration.  The ordering in which samplers execute can also be interleaved.
</p>
<p>Arguments:
</p>
<p>order: A numeric vector, specifying the ordering in which the sampler functions will execute.  The indices of execution specified in this numeric vector correspond to the enumeration of samplers printed by printSamplers(), or returned by getSamplers().  If this argument is omitted, the sampler execution ordering is reset so as to sequentially execute each sampler once.

<p>This function also has the side effect of resetting the sampler execution ordering so as to iterate over the specified set of samplers, sequentially, executing each sampler once.
</p>
<p>Arguments:
</p>
<p>...: Chracter strings or numeric indices.  Character names may be used to specify the node names for samplers to retain.  Numeric indices may be used to specify the indicies for the new list of MCMC samplers, in terms of the current ordered list of samplers.
</p>
<p>ind: A numeric vector or character vector.  A numeric vector may be used to specify the indicies for the new list of MCMC samplers, in terms of the current ordered list of samplers.
For example, if the MCMCconf object currently has 3 samplers, then the ordering may be reversed by calling MCMCconf$setSamplers(3:1), or all samplers may be removed by calling MCMCconf$setSamplers(numeric(0)).
</p>
<p>Alternatively, a character vector may be used to specify a set of model nodes and/or variables, and the sampler list will modified to only those samplers acting on these target nodes.
</p>
<p>As another alternative, a list of samplerConf objects may be used as the argument, in which case this ordered list of samplerConf objects will define the samplers in this MCMC configuration object, completely over-writing the current list of samplers.  No checking is done to ensure the validity of the contents of these samplerConf objects; only that all elements of the list argument are, in fact, samplerConf objects.
