<h2>Builds an MCEM algorithm for a given NIMBLE model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes a NIMBLE model (with some missing data, aka random effects or latent
state nodes) and builds a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM)
algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation. The user can specify which
latent nodes are to be integrated out in the E-Step, or default choices will
be made based on model structure. All other stochastic non-data nodes will be
maximized over. The E-step is done with a sample from a nimble MCMC
algorithm. The M-step is done by a call to <code>optim</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>buildMCEM</code> is a nimbleFunction that creates an MCEM algorithm
for a model and choices (perhaps default) of nodes in different roles in
the model. The MCEM can then be compiled for fast execution with a compiled model.
</p>
<p>Note that <code>buildMCEM</code> was re-written for nimble version 1.2.0 and is not
backward-compatible with previous versions. The new version is considered to
be in beta testing.
</p>
<p>Denote data by Y, latent states (or missing data) by X, and parameters by T.
MCEM works by the following steps, starting from some T:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Draw a sample of size M from P(X | Y, T) using MCMC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Update T to be the maximizer of E[log P(X, Y | T)] where the
expectation is approximated as a Monte Carlo average over the sample from step(1)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Repeat until converged.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The default version of MCEM is the ascent-based MCEM of Caffo et al. (2015).
This attempts to update M when necessary to ensure that step 2 really moves
uphill given that it is maximizing a Monte Carlo approximation and could
accidently move downhill on the real surface of interest due to Monte Carlo
error. The main tuning parameters include <code>alpha</code>, <code>beta</code>, <code>gamma</code>,
<code>Mfactor</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>tol</code> (tolerance).
</p>
<p>If the model supports derivatives via nimble's automatic differentiation (AD)
(and <code>buildDerivs=TRUE</code> in <code>nimbleModel</code>), the maximization step
can use gradients from AD. You must manually set <code>useDerivs=FALSE</code> in
the control list if derivatives aren't supported or if you don't want to use
them.
</p>
<p>In the ascent-based method, after maximization in step 2, the Monte Carlo
standard error of the uphill movement is estimated. If the standardized
uphill step is bigger than 0 with Type I error rate <code>alpha</code>, the
iteration is accepted and the algorithm continues. Otherwise, it is not
certain that step 2 really moved uphill due to Monte Carlo error, so the MCMC
sample size <code>M</code> is incremented by a fixed factor (e.g. 0.33 or 0.5, called
<code>Mfactor</code> in the control list), the additional samples are added by
continuing step 1, and step 2 is tried again. If the Monte Carlo noise still
overwhelms the magnitude of uphill movement, the sample size is increased
again, and so on. <code>alpha</code> should be between 0 and 0.5. A larger value
than usually used for inference is recommended so that there is an easy
threshold to determine uphill movement, which avoids increasing <code>M</code>
prematurely. <code>M</code> will never be increased above <code>maxM</code>.
</p>
<p>Convergence is determined in a similar way. After a definite move uphill, we
determine if the uphill increment is less than <code>tol</code>, with Type I error
rate gamma. (But if <code>M</code> hits a maximum value, the convergence criterion
changes. See below.)
</p>
<p><code>beta</code> is used to help set <code>M</code> to a minimal level based on previous
iterations. This is a desired Type II error rate, assuming an uphill move
and standard error based on the previous iteration. Set <code>adjustM=FALSE</code>
in the control list if you don't want this behavior.
</p>
<p>There are some additional controls on convergence for practical purposes. Set
<code>C</code> in the control list to be the number of times the convergence
criterion mut be satisfied in order to actually stop. E.g setting <code>C=2</code>
means there will always be a restart after the first convergence.
</p>
<p>One problem that can occur with ascent-based MCEM is that the final iteration
can be very slow if M must become very large to satisfy the convergence
criterion. Indeed, if the algorithm starts near the MLE, this can occur. Set
<code>maxM</code> in the control list to set the MCMC sample size that should never
be exceeded.
</p>
<p>If <code>M==maxM</code>, a softer convergence criterion is used. This second
convergence criterion is to stop if we can't be sure we moved uphill using
Type I error rate delta. This is a soft criterion because for small delta,
Type II errors will be common (e.g. if we really did move uphill but can't be
sure from the Monte Carlo sample), allowing the algorithm to terminate. One
can continue the algorithm from where it stopped, so it is helpful to not
have it get stuck when having a very hard time with the first (stricter)
convergence criterion.
</p>
<p>All of <code>alpha</code>, <code>beta</code>, <code>delta</code>, and <code>gamma</code> are utilized
based on asymptotic arguments but in practice must be chosen heuristically.
In other words, their theoretical basis does not exactly yield practical
advice on good choices for efficiency and accuracy, so some trial and error
will be needed.
</p>
<p>It can also be helpful to set a minimum and maximum of allowed iterations (of
steps 1 and 2 above). Setting <code>minIter&gt;1</code> in the control list can
sometimes help avoid a false convergence on the first iteration by forcing at
least one more iteration. Setting <code>maxIter</code> provides a failsafe on a
stuck run.
</p>
<p>If you don't want the ascent-based method at all and simply want to run a set
of iterations, set <code>ascent=FALSE</code> in the control list. This will use the
second (softer) convergence criterion.
</p>
<p>Parameters to be maximized will by default be handled in an unconstrained
parameter space, transformed if necessary by a
<code>parameterTransform</code> object. In that case, the default
<code>optim</code> method will be "BFGS" and can can be changed by setting
<code>optimMehod</code> in the control list. Set <code>useTransform=FALSE</code> in the
control list if you don't want the parameters transformed. In that case the
default <code>optimMethod</code> will be "L-BFGS-B" if there are any actual
constraints, and you can provide a list of <code>boxConstraints</code> in the
control list. (Constraints may be determined by priors written in the model
for parameters, even though their priors play no other role in MLE. E.g.
<code>sigma ~ halfflat()</code> indicates <code>sigma &gt; 0</code>).
</p>
<p>Most of the control list elements can be overridden when calling the
<code>findMLE</code> method. The <code>findMLE</code> argument <code>continue=TRUE</code>
results in attempting to continue the algorithm where the previous call
finished, including whatever settings were in use.
</p>
<p>See <code>setupMargNodes</code> (which is called with the given arguments
for <code>paramNodes</code>, <code>calcNodes</code>, and <code>calcNodesOther</code>; and with
<code>allowDiscreteLatent=TRUE</code>, <code>randomEffectsNodes=latentNodes</code>, and
<code>check=check</code>) for more about how the different groups of nodes are
determined. In general, you can provide none, one, or more of the different
kinds of nodes and <code>setupMargNodes</code> will try to determine the others in
a sensible way. However, note that this cannot work for all ways of writing a
model. One key example is that if random (latent) nodes are written as
top-level nodes (e.g. following <code>N(0,1)</code>), they appear structurally to
be parameters and you must tell <code>buildMCEM</code> that they are
<code>latentNodes</code>. The various "Nodes" arguments will all be passed through
<code>model$expandNodeNames</code>, allowing for example simply "x" to be provided
when there are many nodes within "x".
</p>
<p>Estimating the Monte Carlo standard error of the uphill step is not trivial
because the sample was obtained by MCMC and so likely is autocorrelated. This
is done by calling whatever function in R's global environment is called
"MCEM_mcse", which is required to take two arguments: <code>samples</code> (which
will be a vector of the differences in log(P(Y, X | T)) between the new and
old values of T, across the sample of X) and <code>m</code>, the sample size. It
must return an estimate of the standard error of the mean of the sample.
NIMBLE provides a default version (exported from the package namespace),
which calls <code>mcmcse::mcse</code> with method "obm". Simply provide a different
function with this name in your R session to override NIMBLE's default.

</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>burnin</code> Number of burn-in iterations for the MCMC in step 1. Note
that the initial states of one MCMC will be the last states from the previous
MCMC, so they will often be good initial values after multiple iterations. Default=500.

<li> <p><code>thin</code> Thinning interval for the MCMC in step 1. Default=1.
</p>
</li>

</p>
</li>

<code>configureMCMC</code>, or to <code>config</code> if provided. Default=TRUE.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>derivsDelta</code> If AD derivatives are not used, then the method
<code>vcov</code> must use finite difference derivatives to implement the method of
Louis (1982). The finite differences will be <code>delta</code> or <code>delta/2</code>
for various steps. This is the same for all dimensions. Default=0.0001.
</p>
</li>

<code>config</code> if provided, as the <code>control</code> argument. i.e.
<code>control=mcmcControl</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>boxContrainst</code> List of box constraints for the nodes that will be
maximized over, only relevant if <code>useTransform=FALSE</code> and
<code>forceNoConstraints=FALSE</code> (and ignored otherwise). Each constraint is a
list in which the first element is a character vector of node names to which
the constraint applies and the second element is a vector giving the lower

1. The MCMC configuration is created by calling
</p>
<pre>config(model, nodes = latentNodes, monitors = latentNodes,
thin = thinDefault, control = mcmcControl, print = FALSE) </pre>
<p>The default for <code>config</code> (if it is missing) is <code>configureMCMC</code>,
which is nimble's general default MCMC configuration function.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Methods in the returned algorithm</h3>

<p>The object returned by <code>buildMCEM</code> is a nimbleFunction object with the following methods
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>findMLE</code> is the main method of interest, launching the MCEM
algorithm. It takes the following arguments:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>pStart</code>. Vector of initial parameter values. If omitted, the
values currently in the model object are used.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>returnTrans</code>. Logical indicating whether to return parameters
in the transformed space, if a parameter transformation is in use. Default=FALSE.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>continue</code>. Logical indicating whether to continue the MCEM
from where the last call stopped. In addition, if TRUE, any other control
setting provided in the last call will be used again. If FALSE, all
control settings are reset to the values provided when <code>buildMCEM</code>
was called. Any control settings provided in the same call as
<code>continue=TRUE</code> will over-ride these behaviors and be used in the
continued run.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All run-time control settings available in the <code>control</code> list
for <code>buildMCEM</code> (except for <code>buffer</code>, <code>boxConstraints</code>,
<code>forceNoConstraints</code>, <code>useTransform</code>, and <code>useDerivs</code>) are
accepted as individual arguments to over-ride the values provided in the
<code>control</code> list.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>findMLE</code> returns on object of class <code>optimResultNimbleList</code> with
the results of the final optimization of step 2. The <code>par</code> element of
this list is the vector of maximum likelihood (MLE) parameters.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>vcov</code> computes the approximate variance-covariance matrix of the MLE using
the method of Louis (1982). It takes the following arguments:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>params</code>. Vector of parameters at which to compute the
Hessian matrix used to obtain the <code>vcov</code> result. Typically this
will be <code>MLE$par</code>, if <code>MLE</code> is the output of <code>findMLE</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>trans</code>. Logical indicating whether <code>params</code> is on the
transformed prameter scale, if a parameter transformation is in use.
Typically this should be the same as the <code>returnTrans</code> argument to
<code>findMLE</code>. Default=FALSE.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>returnTrans</code>. Logical indicting whether the <code>vcov</code>
result should be for the transformed parameter space. Default matches
<code>trans</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>M</code>. Number of MCMC samples to obtain if
<code>resetSamples=TRUE</code>. Default is the final value of <code>M</code> from
the last call to <code>findMLE</code>. It can be helpful to increase <code>M</code>
to obtain a more accurate <code>vcov</code> result (i.e. with less Monte Carlo
noise).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>resetSamples</code>. Logical indicating whether to generate a new
MCMC sample from P(X | Y, T), where T is <code>params</code>. If FALSE, the
last sample from <code>findMLE</code> will be used. If MLE convergence was
reasonable, this sample can be used. However, if the last MCEM step made
a big move in parameter space (e.g. if convergence was not achieved),
the last MCMC sample may not be accurate for obtaining <code>vcov</code>. Default=FALSE.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>atMLE</code>. Logical indicating whether you believe the
<code>params</code> represents the MLE. If TRUE, one part of the computation
will be skipped because it is expected to be 0 at the MLE. If there are
parts of the model that are not connected to the latent nodes, i.e. of
<code>calcNodesOther</code> is not empty, then <code>atMLE</code> will be ignored
and set to FALSE. Default=FALSE. It is not really worth using TRUE
unless you are confident and the time saving is meaningful, which is not
very likely. In other words, this argument is provided for technical
completeness.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>vcov</code> returns a matrix that is the inverse of the negative Hessian of
the log likelihood surface, i.e. the usual asymptotic approximation of the
parameter variance-covariance matrix.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>doMCMC</code>. This method runs the MCMC to sample from P(X | Y, T).
One does not need to call this, as it is called via the MCEM algorithm in
<code>findMLE</code>. This method is provided for users who want to use the MCMC
for latent states directly. Samples should be retrieved by
<code>as.matrix(MCEM$mvSamples)</code>, where <code>MCEM</code> is the (compiled or
uncompiled) MCEM algorithm object. This method takes the following arguments:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>M</code>. MCMC sample size.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>thin</code>. MCMC thinning interval.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>reset</code>. Logical indicating whether to reset the MCMC (passed
to the MCMC <code>run</code> method as <code>reset</code>).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <p><code>transform</code> and <code>inverseTransform</code>. Convert a parameter
vector to an unconstrained parameter space and vice-versa, if
<code>useTransform=TRUE</code> in the call to <code>buildDerivs</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>resetControls</code>. Reset all control arguments to the values
provided in the call to <code>buildMCEM</code>. The user does not normally need to
call this.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
