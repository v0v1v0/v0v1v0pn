<h2>Explicitly declare objects created in setup code to be preserved and compiled as member data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Normally a nimbleFunction determines what objects from setup code need to be preserved for run code or other member functions.  <code>setupOutputs</code> allows explicit declaration for cases when an object created in setup code is not used in member functions.
</p>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>An arbitrary set of names</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Normally any object created in <code>setup</code> whose name appears in <code>run</code> or another member function is included in the saved results of setup code.  When the nimbleFunction is compiled, such objects will become member data of the resulting C++ class.  If it is desired to force an object to become member data even if it does not appear in a member function, declare it using <code>setupOutputs</code>.  E.g., <code>setupOutputs(a, b)</code> declares that <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> should be preserved.
</p>
<p>The <code>setupOutputs</code> line will be removed from the setup code.  It is really a marker during nimbleFunction creation of what should be preserved.
