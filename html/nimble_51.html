<h2>Calculating WAIC using an offline algorithm</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In addition to the core online algorithm, NIMBLE implements an offline
WAIC algorithm that can be computed on the results of an MCMC. In contrast
to NIMBLE's built-in online WAIC, offline WAIC can compute only conditional
WAIC and does not allow for grouping data nodes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">calculateWAIC(mcmc, model, nburnin = 0, thin = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mcmc</code></td>
<td>
<p>An MCMC object (compiled or uncompiled) or matrix or dataframe
of MCMC samples as the first argument of <code>calculateWAIC</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>A model (compiled or uncompiled) as the second argument of
<code>calculateWAIC</code>. Only required if <code>mcmc</code> is a matrix/dataframe
of samples.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nburnin</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of pre-thinning MCMC samples to remove from the beginning
of the posterior samples for offline WAIC calculation via <code>calculateWAIC</code>
(default = 0). These samples are discarded in addition to any burn-in specified when
running the MCMC.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>thin</code></td>
<td>
<p>Thinning factor interval to apply to the samples for offline
WAIC calculation using <code>calculateWAIC</code> (default = 1,
corresponding to no thinning).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The ability to calculate WAIC post hoc after all MCMC sampling has been done
has certain advantages (e.g., allowing a user to calculate WAIC from MCMC 
chains run separately) in addition to providing compatibility with versions
of NIMBLE before 0.12.0. This functionality includes the ability to call
the <code>calculateWAIC</code> function on an MCMC object or matrix of samples
after running an MCMC and without setting up the MCMC initially to use WAIC.
</p>
<p>Important: The necessary variables to compute WAIC (all stochastic parent
nodes of the data nodes) must have been monitored when setting up the MCMC.
</p>
<p>Also note that while the <code>model</code> argument can be either a compiled or
uncompiled model, the model must have been compiled prior to calling
<code>calculateWAIC</code>.
</p>
<p>See <code>help(waic)</code> for details on using NIMBLE's recommended online
algorithm for WAIC.

<h3>Offline WAIC (WAIC computed after MCMC sampling)</h3>

<p>As an alternative to online WAIC, NIMBLE also provides a function,
<code>calculateWAIC</code>, that can be called on an MCMC object or a matrix of
samples, after running an MCMC. This function does not require that one
set <code>enableWAIC = TRUE</code> nor <code>WAIC = TRUE</code> when calling
<code>runMCMC</code>. The function checks that the necessary variables were
monitored in the MCMC and returns an error if they were not. This function
behaves identically to the <code>calculateWAIC</code> method of an MCMC object.
Note that to use this function when using <code>nimbleMCMC</code> one would
need to build the model outside of <code>nimbleMCMC</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>calculateWAIC</code> function requires either an MCMC object or a matrix
(or dataframe) of posterior samples plus a model object. In addition, one
can provide optional <code>burnin</code> and <code>thin</code> arguments.
</p>
<p>In addition, for compatibility with older versions of NIMBLE (prior to
v0.12.0), one can also use the <code>calculateWAIC</code> method of the MCMC
object to calculate WAIC after all sampling has been completed.
</p>
<p>The <code>calculateWAIC()</code> method accepts a single argument, <code>nburnin</code>,
equivalent to the <code>nburnin</code> argument of the <code>calculateWAIC</code>
function described above.
</p>
<p>The <code>calculateWAIC</code> method can only be used if the <code>enableWAIC</code> 
argument to <code>configureMCMC</code> or to <code>buildMCMC</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>,
or if the NIMBLE option <code>enableWAIC</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>.  If a user
attempts to call <code>calculateWAIC</code> without having set
<code>enableWAIC = TRUE</code> (either in the call to <code>configureMCMC</code>, or
<code>buildMCMC</code>, or as a NIMBLE option), an error will occur.  
</p>
<p>The <code>calculateWAIC</code> function and method calculate the WAIC based on
Equations 5, 12, and 13 in Gelman et al. (2014) (i.e., using <em>p</em>WAIC2).
</p>
<p>Note that there is not a unique value of WAIC for a model. The 
<code>calculateWAIC</code> function and method only provide the conditional WAIC,
namely the version of WAIC where all parameters directly involved in the
likelihood are treated as <code class="reqn">theta</code> for the purposes of Equation 5 from
Gelman et al. (2014). As a result, the user must set the MCMC monitors
(via the <code>monitors</code> argument) to include all stochastic nodes that
are parents of any data nodes; by default the MCMC monitors are only the
top-level nodes of the model. For more detail on the use of different
predictive distributions, see Section 2.5 from Gelman et al. (2014) or
Ariyo et al. (2019).
Also note that WAIC relies on a partition of the observations, i.e.,
'pointwise' prediction. In <code>calculateWAIC</code> the sum over log pointwise
predictive density values treats each data node as contributing a single
value to the sum. When a data node is multivariate, that data node contributes
a single value to the sum based on the joint density of the elements in the
node. Note that if one wants the WAIC calculation via <code>calculateWAIC</code>
to be based on the joint predictive density for each group of observations
(e.g., grouping the observations from each person or unit in a longitudinal
data context), one would need to use a multivariate distribution for the
observations in each group (potentially by writing a user-defined
distribution).
