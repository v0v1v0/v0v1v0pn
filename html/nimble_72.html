<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Check for interrupt (e.g. Ctrl-C) during nimbleFunction execution. Part of the NIMBLE language.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">checkInterrupt()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>During execution of nimbleFunctions that take a long time, it is nice to occassionally check if the user has entered an interrupt and bail out of execution if so.  This function does that.  During uncompiled nimbleFunction execution, it does nothing.  During compiled execution, it calls R_checkUserInterrupt() of the R headers.
