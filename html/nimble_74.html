<h2>Clear compiled objects from a project and unload shared library</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Clear all compiled objects from a project and unload the shared library produced by the C++ compiler. Has no effect on Windows.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">clearCompiled(obj)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>obj</code></td>
<td>
<p>A compiled nimbleFunction or nimble model</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This will clear all compiled objects associated with your NIMBLE project.  For example, if <code>cModel</code> is a compiled model, <code>clearCompiled(cModel)</code> will clear both the model and all associated nimbleFunctions such as compiled MCMCs that use that model.
</p>
<p>Use of this function can be dangerous.  There is some risk that if you have copies of the R objects that interfaced to compiled C++ objects that have been removed, and you attempt to use those R objects after clearing their compiled counterparts, you will crash R.  We have tried to minimize that risk, but we can't guarantee safe behavior.
