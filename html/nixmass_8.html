<h2>Statistical SWE modeling depending on the day-of-year</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This model parameterizes bulk snow density with day-of-the-year as the only input. It was calibrated for the region of South Tyrol, Italy, and is therefore called ST model in the original reference.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">swe.pi16(data, rho_0=200, K=1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data.frame of daily observations with two columns named <em>date</em> and <em>hs</em> referring to day and snow depth at that day. The date column must be a character string with the format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>. The hs column must be snow depth values <code class="reqn">\ge 0</code> in m. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rho_0</code></td>
<td>
<p>Intercept of the linear regression between observed snow depths and SWE values. <code>rho_0</code> is set to 200 as default, which is the value from the original reference. It can however be set to any value according to regression modeling with other datasets.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>K</code></td>
<td>
<p>Slope of the linear regression between observed densities and the day-of-year as defined in the original reference. <code>K</code> is set to 1 as default, which is the value from the original reference. It can however be set to any value according to regression modeling with other datasets. </p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>swe.pi16</code> This function uses only the day-of-year (DOY) as parameterization for bulk snow density and hence SWE. Here, the datums in the input data.frame are converted to DOY as defined in the original reference: negative values between 1.10. and 31.12. DOY=-92 at 1.10. In leap years 31.12. has DOY = 0, in non-leap years 31.12. has DOY = -1 with no day being 0. Non computable values are returned as NA.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector with daily SWE values in mm.
