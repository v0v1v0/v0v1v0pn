<h2>Cardiotocography</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Cardiotocography data from UCI machine learning repository. Raw data have been 
cleaned and an <code>outcome</code> column added that is a binary variable of predicting
NSP (described below) = 2.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data Set Information:
2126 fetal cardiotocograms (CTGs) were automatically processed and the respective diagnostic features measured. 
The CTGs were also classified by three expert obstetricians and a consensus classification label assigned to each of them. Classification was both with respect to a morphologic pattern (A, B, C. ...) and to a fetal state (N, S, P). Therefore the dataset can be used either for 10-class or 3-class experiments.
