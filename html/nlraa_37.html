<h2>Maize leaf extension rate as a response to temperature</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data on leaf extension rate as a response to meristem temperature
in maize. The data are re-created liberally from 
Walls, W.R., 1971. Role of temperature in the regulation of leaf extension in Zea mays. Nature, 229: 46-47. 
The data points are not the same as in the original paper. Some additional
points were inserted to fill in the blanks and allow for reasonable
parameter estimates
