<h2>nlrx: A package for running NetLogo simulations from R.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The nlrx package provides tools to setup NetLogo simulations in R.
It uses a similar structure as NetLogos Behavior Space but offers more flexibility and additional tools for running sensitivity analyses.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Get started:
</p>
<p>General information that is needed to run NetLogo simulations remotely, such as path to the NetLogo installation folder is stored within a <code>nl</code> class object.
Nested within this <code>nl</code> class are the classes <code>experiment</code> and <code>simdesign</code>. The <code>experiment</code> class stores all experiment specifications.
After attaching a valid experiment, a <code>simdesign</code> class object can be attached to the <code>nl</code> class object, by using one of the simdesign helper functions.
These helper functions create different parameter input matrices from the experiment variable definitions that can then be executed by the <code>run_nl_one()</code> and <code>run_nl_all()</code> functions.
The nested design allows to store everything related to the experiment within one R object.
Additionally, different simdesign helper functions can be applied to the same <code>nl</code> object in order to repeat the same experiment with different parameter exploration methods (simdesigns).
</p>
<p>Step by step application example
</p>
<p>The "Wolf Sheep Predation" model from the NetLogo models library is used to present a basic example on how to setup and run NetLogo model simulations from R.
</p>
<p>Step 1: Create a nl object:
</p>
<p>The nl object holds all information on the NetLogo version, a path to the NetLogo directory with the defined version, a path to the model file, and the desired memory for the java virtual machine.
Depending on the operation system, paths to NetLogo and the model need to be adjusted.
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>library(nlrx)
# Windows default NetLogo installation path (adjust to your needs!):
netlogopath &lt;- file.path("C:/Program Files/NetLogo 6.0.3")
modelpath &lt;- file.path(netlogopath, "app/models/Sample Models/Biology/Wolf Sheep Predation.nlogo")
outpath &lt;- file.path("C:/out")
# Unix default NetLogo installation path (adjust to your needs!):
netlogopath &lt;- file.path("/home/NetLogo 6.0.3")
modelpath &lt;- file.path(netlogopath, "app/models/Sample Models/Biology/Wolf Sheep Predation.nlogo")
outpath &lt;- file.path("/home/out")
nl &lt;- nl(nlversion = "6.0.3",
         nlpath = netlogopath,
         modelpath = modelpath,
         jvmmem = 1024)
</pre></div>
<p>Step 2: Attach an experiment
</p>
<p>The experiment object is organized in a similar fashion as NetLogo Behavior Space experiments.
It contains all information that is needed to generate a simulation parameter matrix and to execute the NetLogo simulations.
Details on the specific slots of the experiment class can be found in the package documentation (<code>?experiment</code>) and the "Advanced configuration" vignette.
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>nl@experiment &lt;- experiment(expname="wolf-sheep",
                             outpath=outpath,
                             repetition=1,
                             tickmetrics="true",
                             idsetup="setup",
                             idgo="go",
                             runtime=50,
                             evalticks=seq(40,50),
                             metrics=c("count sheep", "count wolves", "count patches with [pcolor = green]"),
                             variables = list('initial-number-sheep' = list(min=50, max=150, qfun="qunif"),
                                              'initial-number-wolves' = list(min=50, max=150, qfun="qunif")),
                             constants = list("model-version" = "\"sheep-wolves-grass\"",
                                              "grass-regrowth-time" = 30,
                                              "sheep-gain-from-food" = 4,
                                              "wolf-gain-from-food" = 20,
                                              "sheep-reproduce" = 4,
                                              "wolf-reproduce" = 5,
                                              "show-energy?" = "false"))
</pre></div>
<p>Step 3: Attach a simulation design
</p>
<p>While the experiment defines the variables and specifications of the model, the simulation design creates a parameter input table based on these model specifications and the chosen simulation design method.
nlrx provides a bunch of different simulation designs, such as full-factorial, latin-hypercube, sobol, morris and eFast (see "Simdesign Examples" vignette for more information on simdesigns).
All simdesign helper functions need a properly defined nl object with a valid experiment design.
Each simdesign helper also allows to define a number of random seeds that are randomly generated and can be used to execute repeated simulations of the same parameter matrix with different random-seeds (see "Advanced configuration" vignette for more information on random-seed and repetition management).
A simulation design is attached to a nl object by using one of the simdesign helper functions:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>nl@simdesign &lt;- simdesign_lhs(nl=nl,
                               samples=100,
                               nseeds=3,
                               precision=3)
</pre></div>
<p>Step 4: Run simulations
</p>
<p>All information that is needed to run the simulations is now stored within the nl object.
The <code>run_nl_one()</code> function allows to run one specific simulation from the siminput parameter table.
The <code>run_nl_all()</code> function runs a loop over all simseeds and rows of the parameter input table siminput.
The loops are constructed in a way that allows easy parallelisation, either locally or on remote HPC machines (see "Advanced configuration" vignette for more information on parallelisation).
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>results &lt;- run_nl_all(nl = nl)
</pre></div>
<p>Step 5: Attach results to nl and run analysis
</p>
<p>nlrx provides method specific analysis functions for each simulation design.
Depending on the chosen design, the function reports a tibble with aggregated results or sensitivity indices.
In order to run the <code>analyze_nl()</code> function, the simulation output has to be attached to the nl object first.
After attaching the simulation results, these can also be written to the defined outpath of the experiment object.
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre># Attach results to nl object:
setsim(nl, "simoutput") &lt;- results
# Write output to outpath of experiment within nl
write_simoutput(nl)
# Do further analysis:
analyze_nl(nl)
</pre></div>
