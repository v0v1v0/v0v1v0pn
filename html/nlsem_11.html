<h2>Data from Jordan subset of PISA 2006 data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data stem from the large-scale assessment study PISA 2006
(Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, 2009) where
competencies of 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics, and science
are assessed using nationally representative samples in 3-year cycles. In
this example, data from the student background questionnaire from the
Jordan sample of PISA 2006 were used. Only data of students with complete
responses to all 15 items (N = 6,038) were considered.
