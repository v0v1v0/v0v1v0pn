<h2>Package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A package for estimating population eigenvalues and covariance
matrices, based on publications by Ledoit and Wolf (2004, 2012, 2015,
2016).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A common assumption in statistics is that for a data matrix <code class="reqn">X</code>
of dimension <code class="reqn">n \times p</code>, the number of predictor variables (p)
vanishes relative to the number of datapoints (n) as <code class="reqn">n \to \infty</code>.
However, in modern datasets, it is often the case that p is comparable to
or greater than n. In this scenario, a more appropriate asymptotic
framework is to assume that the ratio <code class="reqn">c := p/n</code> approaches a finite
positive value as <code class="reqn">n,p \to \infty</code>. In this case, the sample covariance
matrix <code class="reqn">S</code> is no longer a consistent estimator of the population
covariance matrix <code class="reqn">\Sigma</code>. Similarly, the sample eigenvalues deviate
substantially from the population eigenvalues. This package contains
implementations of Ledoit and Wolf's linear and non-linear shrinkage
population eigenvalue and covariance estimation methods, based on their
2016 publication and the accompanying MATLAB code. Theoretical and
implementation details of these methods can be found in the following
