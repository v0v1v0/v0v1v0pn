<h2>nmaINLA: Network meta-analysis using INLA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An R package for performing network meta-analysis using INLA.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Network meta-analysis is a generalization of pairwise meta-analysis to analyze networks
of trials comparing two or more treatments simultaneously (Dias et al, 2011). Bayesian
hierarchical models are commonly used for network meta-analysis (Dias et al, 2011). The
default choice for performing inference within such models are Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC), for example using BUGS-variants programs such as JAGS. A deterministic approach
to do fully Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs) are integrated nested
Laplace approximations (INLA) (Rue et al, 2009) which is a fast and accurate alternative
to MCMC. INLA methodology is implemented as an R package INLA (&lt;www.r-inla.org&gt;). Sauter
and Held (2015) has shown that INLA can be used for fitting many NMA models including
fixed effect and consistency models, node-splitting models.
</p>
<p>This package extends the INLA implementation of Sauter and Held (2015) to Jackson
model (Jackson et al, 2014) and network meta-regression and extracts the
features needed for NMA models from INLA R package and presents
in an intuitive way (Guenhan et al, 2018). Currently, contrast-based network
meta-analysis using trial-arm level data for datasets with binary, continuous, and survival outcomes are supported.
Note that the installation of R package
'INLA' is compulsory for successful usage. The 'INLA' package can be obtained from
&lt;http://www.r-inla.org&gt;. We recommend the testing version, which can be downloaded
by running: install.packages("INLA",repos=c(getOption("repos"),
INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/testing"), dep=TRUE).
</p>
<p>Type vignette("nmaINLA") to how to use this package.
</p>
<p>The development version of nmaINLA is available on GitHub &lt;https://github.com/gunhanb/nmaINLA&gt;.
