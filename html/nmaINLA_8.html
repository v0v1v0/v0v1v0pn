<h2>Data for the Flour NMA example in Dias et al. (2010)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The flour dataset describes a network comparing 6 treatments with 130 trials.
There are 121 pairwise comparisons, 8 three-arm trials and 1 four-arm trial. The main outcome
is caries increment, as measured by the change in decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces
(DMFS) in the permanent dentition of children. Data that are available for study i include the
mean caries increment in trial i arm k, y ik, the number of patients at risk in each trial arm, n ik,
the time that individuals are at risk in arm k of study i, t i (measured as the trial follow-up
time, which is the same for both arms) and the interventions being compared.
