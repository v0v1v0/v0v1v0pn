<h2>Define which hierarchies to select</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Defines a condition that is of interest to be satisfied involving a
set of treatments in the network.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following types of conditions are available.
</p>
<p>The condition <code>fn = "sameHierarchy"</code> checks whether a specific
hierarchy occurs. One additional unnamed argument has to be
provided in '...': a vector with a permutation of all treatment
names in the network.
</p>
<p>The condition <code>fn = "specificPosition"</code> checks whether a
treatment ranks in a specific position. Two additional unnamed
arguments have to be provided in '...': (1) name of the treatment
of interest and (2) a single numeric specifying the rank position.
</p>
<p>The condition <code>fn = "betterEqual"</code> checks whether a treatment
has a position better or equal to a specific rank. Two additional
unnamed arguments have to be provided in '...': (1) name of the
treatment of interest and (2) a single numeric specifying the rank
position.
</p>
<p>The condition <code>fn = "retainOrder"</code> checks whether a specific
order of two or more treatments is retained anywhere in the
hierarchy. One additional unnamed argument has to be provided in
'...': a vector with two or more treatment names providing the
order of treatments.
</p>
<p>The condition <code>fn = "biggerCIV"</code> checks whether the effect of
a treatment is bigger than that of a second treatment by more than
a given clinically important value (CIV) on an additive scale
(e.g. log odds ratio, log risk ratio, mean difference). Three
additional unnamed arguments have to be provided in '...': (1)
name of the first treatment, (2) name of the second treatment and
(3) a numerical value for the CIV. Note that the actual value of
the relative effect is considered independently of whether
<code>small.values</code> is <code>"desirable"</code> or <code>"undesirable"</code>.
</p>
<p><b>Composition of conditions for more complex queries:</b>
</p>
<p>Conditions can be combined to express more complex decision
trees. This can be done by using the special operators %AND%,
%OR%, %XOR% and the <code>opposite</code> function. The combination
should be defined as a binary tree with the use of parentheses. If
A, B, C and D are conditions, we can for example combine them into
a complex condition E:
</p>
<p><code>E = A %AND% (B %OR% (opposite(C) %XOR% D))</code>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with the defined function and its arguments.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("Woods2010", package = "netmeta")
p1 &lt;- pairwise(treatment, event = r, n = N, studlab = author,
  data = Woods2010, sm = "OR")
net1 &lt;- netmeta(p1, small.values = "good")

# criterionA if all treatments are in the exact defined order
criterionA &lt;-
condition("sameHierarchy",
  c("SFC", "Salmeterol", "Fluticasone", "Placebo"))

# criterionB respects the relative order of two or more treatments
criterionB &lt;-
  condition("retainOrder",
    c("SFC", "Fluticasone", "Placebo"))

# Below we define the condition that SFC and Salmeterol are in the
# first two positions.

# We first define conditions that each one of them is in position 1
# or 2 
criterionC1 &lt;- condition("betterEqual", "SFC", 2)
criterionC2 &lt;- condition("betterEqual", "Salmeterol", 2)
# We then combine them with operator %AND%
criterionC &lt;- criterionC1 %AND% criterionC2

# Next we can feed the condition into nmarank to get the
# probability of the selection
nmarank(net1, criterionC,
  text.condition =
    "SFC and Salmeterol are the two best options", nsim = 100)

# We can further combine criteria
criterionD &lt;- criterionA %AND% (criterionB %OR% opposite(criterionC))
