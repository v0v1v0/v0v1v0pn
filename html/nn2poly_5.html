<h2>Obtain polynomial representation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements the main NN2Poly algorithm to obtain a polynomial representation
of a trained neural network using its weights and Taylor expansion of its
activation functions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">nn2poly(
  object,
  max_order = 2,
  keep_layers = FALSE,
  taylor_orders = 8,
  ...,
  all_partitions = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object for which the computation of the NN2Poly algorithm is
desired. Currently supports models from the following deep learning frameworks:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>tensorflow</code>/<code>keras</code> models built as a sequential model.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>torch</code>/<code>luz</code> models built as a sequential model.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It also supports a named <code>list</code> as input which allows to introduce by
hand a model from any other source. This <code>list</code> should be of length L
(number of hidden layers + 1) containing the weights matrix for each layer.
Each element of the list should be named as the activation function used at
each layer. Currently supported activation functions are <code>"tanh"</code>,
<code>"softplus"</code>, <code>"sigmoid"</code> and <code>"linear"</code>.
</p>
<p>At any layer <code class="reqn">l</code>, the expected shape of such matrices is of the form
<code class="reqn">(h_{(l-1)} + 1)*(h_l)</code>, that is, the number of rows is the number of
neurons in the previous layer plus the bias vector, and the number of columns
is the number of neurons in the current layer L. Therefore, each column
corresponds to the weight vector affecting each neuron in that layer.
The bias vector should be in the first row.</p>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_order</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>integer</code> that determines the maximum order
that will be forced in the final polynomial, discarding terms of higher order
that would naturally arise when considering all Taylor expansions allowed by
<code>taylor_orders</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep_layers</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean that determines if all polynomials computed in
the internal layers have to be stored and given in the output (<code>TRUE</code>),
or if only the polynomials from the last layer are needed (<code>FALSE</code>).
Default set to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>taylor_orders</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>integer</code> or <code>vector</code> of length L that sets the
degree at which Taylor expansion is truncated at each layer. If a single
value is used, that value is set for each non linear layer and 1 for linear
at each layer activation function. Default set to <code>8</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Ignored.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>all_partitions</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional argument containing the needed multipartitions
as list of lists of lists. If set to <code>NULL</code>, nn2poly will compute said
multipartitions. This step can be computationally expensive when the chosen
polynomial order or the dimension are too high. In such cases, it is
encouraged that the multipartitions are stored and reused when possible.
Default set to <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns an object of class <code>nn2poly</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>keep_layers = FALSE</code> (default case), it returns a list with two
items:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p> An item named <code>labels</code> that is a list of integer vectors. Those vectors
represent each monomial in the polynomial, where each integer in the vector
represents each time one of the original variables appears in that term.
As an example, vector c(1,1,2) represents the term <code class="reqn">x_1^2x_2</code>. Note that
the variables are numbered from 1 to p, with the intercept is represented by
</p>
</li></ul>
<ol><li> 
</li></ol>
<ul><li>
<p> An item named <code>values</code> which contains a matrix in which each column contains
the coefficients of the polynomial associated with an output neuron. That is,
if the neural network has a single output unit, the matrix <code>values</code> will have
a single column and if it has multiple output units, the matrix <code>values</code> will
have several columns. Each row will be the coefficient associated with the
label in the same position in the labels list.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If <code>keep_layers = TRUE</code>, it returns a list of length the number of
layers (represented by <code>layer_i</code>), where each one is another list with
<code>input</code> and <code>output</code> elements. Each of those elements contains an
item as explained before. The last layer output item will be the same element
as if <code>keep_layers = FALSE</code>.
</p>
<p>The polynomials obtained at the hidden layers are not needed to represent the
NN but can be used to explore other insights from the NN.
