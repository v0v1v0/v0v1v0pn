<h2>Match events by forecast zone to county</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For events reported by forecast zone, use regular expressions to match
as many as possible to counties.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">match_forecast_county(storm_data_z)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>storm_data_z</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dataframe of storm events reported by forecast zone
(i.e., <code>cz_type == "Z"</code>) rather than county. This dataframe should
include the columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>state</code>: State name, in lowercase
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>cz_name</code>: Location name, in lowercase
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>cz_fips</code>: Forecast zone FIPS
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function tries to match the <code>cz_name</code> of each event to
a state and county name from the <code>county.fips</code> dataframe that comes
with the <code>maps</code> package. The following steps are taken to try to
match each <code>cz_name</code> to a state and county name from <code>county.fips</code>:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Tries to match <code>cz_name</code> to the county name in <code>county.fips</code>
after removing any periods or apostrophes in <code>cz_name</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Next, for county names with "county" in them, try to match the word before
"county" to county name in <code>county.fips</code>. Then check the two words before
"county", then the one and two words before "counties".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Next, pull out the last word in <code>cz_name</code> and try to match it to the county
name in <code>county.fips</code>. The check the last two words in <code>cz_name</code>, then check
the last three words in <code>cz_name</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Next, pull any words right before a slash and check that against the county name.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Finally, try removing anything in parentheses in <code>cz_name</code> before matching.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The dataframe of events input to the function, with county FIPS
added for events matched to a county in the <code>fips</code> column. Events
that could not be matched are kept in the dataframe, but the <code>fips</code>
code is set to <code>NA</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function does not provide any matches for events outside
of the continental U.S.
</p>
<p>You may want to hand-check that event listings with names like "Lake", "Mountain", and
"Park" have not been unintentionally linked to a county like "Lake County". While such
examples seem rare in the example data used to develop this function (NOAA Storm Events
for 2015), it can sometimes happen. To do so, you can use the <code>str_detect</code> function
from the <code>stringr</code> package.
