<h2>Nonparametric methods for smoothing nonsmooth data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides nonparametric methods for smoothing nonsmooth data.
Change-point data is the intended application, with a focus on those with
jumps in the regression function. Descriptions of the implementation of these
methods can be found in Thompson, J.R.J. (2024).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package contains two additional functions for simulated one-D and two-D
change-point data. This package also contains a real fire spread dataset from
a micro-fire experiment. This data can be viewed as time dependent
two-dimensional change-point data. The boundaries between fuel, burning and
burn-out regions are seperated by two change-point curves. More information
on experimentation and data can befound in Thompson, Wang, and Braun (2020)
and Wang, Thompson, and Braun (2019).
