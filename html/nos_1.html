<h2>nos: A package for calculating node overlap and segregation in ecological
networks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A package to calculate NOS (node overlap and segregation) and
the associated metrics described in Strona and Veech (2015) and Strona et
al. (2017). The functions provided in the package enable assessment of
structural patterns ranging from complete node segregation to perfect
nestedness in a variety of network types. In addition, they provide a
measure of network modularity.
</p>
<p>Does not currently work on Macs (OS X El Capitan) as the dependent
gmp package is not yet available in binary form for OS X El Capitan.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are five main S3 generics that the user can choose depending
on whether a directed, bipartite or undirected network is provided as
input, and whether a network of potential interactions (pot_net) is
available from the user. These five functions are: 1) NOSM_dir - for
directed unimode networks (e.g. food webs) when pot_net is not provided, 2)
NOSM_undir - for undirected networks (e.g. co-occurrence networks) when
pot_net is not provided, 3) NOSM_bip - for bipartite networks (e.g.
plant-pollinator networks), 4) NOSM_pot_dir - for directed unimode (e.g.
food webs) and bipartite networks when pot_net is provided, and 5)
NOSM_pot_undir - for undirected networks (e.g. co-occurrence networks) when
pot_net is provided.
</p>
<p>Each of these five main functions produces an output with class 'NOSM'. An
S3 method (summary.NOSM) provides the summary statistics of interest (e.g..
NOS, Mod/network modularity, effect size Z, and p-value).
</p>
<p>If a network of potential interactions is not provided, the computation will
be made according to the following criteria: in an undirected network, all
nodes will be considered as potential interacting partners; in a directed,
unimode network, all nodes having at least an in-coming link will be
considered as potential partners for nodes having at least an out-going link
and vice-versa; in a bipartite network, where nodes can be formally
categorized into two distinct categories (e.g. plant-pollinators) all nodes
in one category will be considered as potential partners for the nodes in
the other category (and vice-versa).
</p>
<p>Input data should be in the form of an edge list or frequency interaction
matrix (this can be either a bipartite graph type or a squared adjacency
matrix type). If the input data are in the format of a frequency interaction
matrix, as used in the bipartite R package, then
<code>freqMat_2_edge</code> should be used first, to convert the
interaction matrix to an edge list prior to running any 'nos' functions.
</p>
<p>The internal function comb calculates factorials. If the user provided
n or k are too large (&gt; roughly 170) factorial(n || k) produces Inf.
In these cases gmp::factorialZ is used instead. See the help documentation
for the 'gmp' package for further information.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that due to differences in the way R and Python calculate
the standard deviation, the modularity values and z values calculated using
this R package differ very slightly (less than 0.2) from the values
calculated using the Python scrip from Strona et al. (2017).
