<h2>Compute NOS using a bipartite network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computation of NOS using a bipartite network (e.g.
plant-pollinator network), where nodes can be formally categorized into two
distinct categories (e.g. plant-pollinators). All nodes in one category
will be considered as potential partners for the nodes in the other
category (and vice-versa).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">NOSM_bip(net, perc = 1, sl = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>net</code></td>
<td>
<p>A network, in the form of an edge list. This should be a matrix or
dataframe with two columns. Each value in a column is a node (e.g. a food
item in a trophic-web). Nodes can be identified using numbers or
characters. For each row (i.e. node pair), the value in the first column is
'consumed' (or pollinated, parasitized etc) by the value in the second
column. Data can also be in the format of a frequency interaction matrix,
as used in the bipartite R package. In these cases
<code>freqMat_2_edge</code> should be used first, to convert the
interaction matrix to an edge list.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>perc</code></td>
<td>
<p>(default to 1) - the fraction of node pair comparisons to be
performed to compute NOS. We recommend performing all possible pair
comparisons (perc = 1). However, for exploratory analyses on large sets of
networks (or for very large networks), the possibility of using a lower
fraction of pair comparisons is a useful option.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sl</code></td>
<td>
<p>(default is 1) Specifies whether cannibalistic interactions should
be considered as possible and therefore taken into account and removed
during computation ('1') or not ('0').</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list (two elements) of class 'NOSM' with a 'Type' attribute 'bip'.
The first element in the list is a vector of overlap values for the "in
nodes" and the second element is a vector of overlap values for the "out
nodes".
</p>
<p>The <code>summary.NOSM</code> methods provides more useful summary
statistics.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(boreal)
y &lt;-  boreal[sample(rownames(boreal), 100, FALSE),] #subset 100 rows for speed
x &lt;- NOSM_bip(y, perc = 1, sl = 1)
summary(x)
</code></pre>
