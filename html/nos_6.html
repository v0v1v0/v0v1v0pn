<h2>Compute NOS using a directed network and with a user provided network
of potential interactions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computation of NOS using an directed network (e.g. a
food web) and with a user provided network of potential interactions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">NOSM_POT_dir(net, pot_net, perc = 1, sl = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>net</code></td>
<td>
<p>A network, in the form of an edge list. This should be a matrix or
dataframe with two columns. Each value in a column is a node. Nodes can be
identified using numbers or characters.Data can also be in the format of a
frequency interaction matrix, as used in the bipartite R
package. In these cases <code>freqMat_2_edge</code> should be used first,
to convert the interaction matrix to an edge list.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pot_net</code></td>
<td>
<p>A network of all potential interactions. These should include,
as a minimum, all the observed interactions (i.e. all links in net),plus
any other possible interaction (such as all those permitted by a certain
trophic rule). pot_net should have the same structure as net (e.g. it
should be a data frame or matrix).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>perc</code></td>
<td>
<p>(default to 1) - the fraction of node pair comparisons to be
performed to compute NOS. We recommend performing all possible pair
comparisons (perc = 1). However, for exploratory analyses on large sets of
networks (or for very large networks), the possibility of using a lower
fraction of pair comparisons is a useful option.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sl</code></td>
<td>
<p>(default is 1) Specifies whether cannibalistic interactions should
be considered as possible and therefore taken into account and removed
during computation ('1') or not ('0').</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list (two elements) of class 'NOSM' with a 'Type' attribute
'Pot_dir'. The first element in the list is a vector of overlap values for
the "in nodes" and the second element is a vector of overlap values for the
"out nodes".
</p>
<p>The <code>summary.NOSM</code> methods provides more useful summary
statistics.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(boreal)
y &lt;-  boreal[1:300,] #subset 300 rows for speed
d &lt;- sample(nrow(y), 200, replace = FALSE) #create a random pot_net
pot_net &lt;- y[d,] #by randomly sampling 200 rows from boreal
x &lt;- NOSM_POT_dir(y, pot_net, perc = 1, sl = 1)
summary(x)
</code></pre>
