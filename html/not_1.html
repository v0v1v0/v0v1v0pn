<h2>Narrowest-Over-Threshold Change-Point Detection</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements the Narrowest-Over-Threshold approach for general multiple change-point 
detection in one-dimensional data following 'deterministic signal + noise' model. Scenarios that are currently implemented are: piecewise-constant signal, piecewise-constant signal with a heavy tailed noise, piecewise-linear signal, piecewise-quadratic signal, piecewise-constant signal and with piecewise-constant standard deviation of the noise. The main routines of the package are <code>not</code> and <code>features</code>.
