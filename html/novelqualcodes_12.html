<h2>Score novel and duplicates codes across interviews</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>'Novel' and 'duplicate' codes are scored once per interview; the number of
times they are spoken in an interview does not matter.
</p>
<p>The definition of whether a code is <em>novel</em> or <em>duplicated</em> is
entirely chronological:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> A <strong>novel code</strong> is a topic/idea/concept that, for example, is mentioned in
Interview 17, but was not mentioned in Interviews 1 through 16.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A <strong>duplicate code</strong> is one that has been talked about in other interviews
previously.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The cumulative sum of novel codes is used to visualise a stopping
point for qualitative interviews.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">score_codes(interviews)

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>interviews</code></td>
<td>
<p>(List) A list of dataframes, as generated by <code>import_coding_matrices()</code>.</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe, with one row per interview and these columns:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>itvw_seq</code>, the chronological order of interviews.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>n_codes</code>, the number of unique codes mentioned in this interview.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>n_duplicate</code>, how many of those codes are duplicates mentioned in previous interviews).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>n_novel</code>, how many of those codes are novel (mentioned for the first time in this interview).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>prop_duplicate</code>, the proportion of this interview's codes that are duplicates.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>prop_novel</code>, the proportion of this interview's codes that are novel.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>cumsum_novel</code>, the cumulative sum of novel codes over time (i.e. across interviews).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># A folder of example coding matrices included with the package
path_to_matrices &lt;- system.file("insect_study/matrices/", package = "novelqualcodes")
print(path_to_matrices)

# A list of files in that folder
list.files(path_to_matrices)

# Import them all at once
my_matrices &lt;- import_coding_matrices(path_to_matrices)

# Score them for novel and duplicate codes
my_scores &lt;- score_codes(my_matrices)

# Look inside the result; novel and duplicate codes are scored across
# all interviews.
print(my_scores)
