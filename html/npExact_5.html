<h2>Nonparametric hypothesis tests</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>npExact</code> provides distribution-free hypothesis tests.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package contains several new hypothesis tests, which do
not require that the user makes assumptions on the underlying
distributions.
</p>
<p>However, all tests except <code>npStochin</code> can only be
applied if there are exogenously given bounds known to the
user before gathering the data such that it is known by
definition of the underlying process that all observations
lie within these bounds.
</p>
<p>So for instance, if the data involves percentages then the
lower bound is 0 and the upper bound is 100, by definition of
the data and not something (like normality) that cannot be
deduced from the properties of the data.

<pre><code class="language-R">
## npMeanPaired
## test whether pain after the surgery is less than before the surgery
data(pain)
npMeanPaired(pain$before, pain$after, lower = 0, upper = 100)

## npMeanUnpaired
## test whether countries with french origin score lower than
## countries with no french origin
data(french)
origin &lt;- french$french.origin
