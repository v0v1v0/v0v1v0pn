<h2>Rat growth study</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Measurements of body weights (in grams) of rats.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(rat)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Longitudinal data of 27 rats with body weight measurements from both control and treatment groups taken over a 5-week period.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In clinical chemistry, it is important for the determination of reference intervals to investigate whether a variable of interest has a circadian rhythm. If so, the reference intervals cannot be determined independently of time. This question is to be analyzed in the case of alpha-amylase in saliva. Measurements of alpha-amylase levels were taken from the saliva of 14 volunteers, four times per day (8 a.m., 12 p.m., 5 p.m., 9 p.m.) on two days (Monday (m), Thursday (t)), since differences in the alpha-amylase profiles immediately after a weekend as opposed to the middle of the week are suspected. Thus, each subject was examined on Monday and Thursday.
</p>
<p>Box (1950) and Wolfinger (1996) consider the growth curve problem using the body weight measurements of 27 rats. In the data, 10 rats are in the control group while the remaining 17 rats are in two treatment groups. The treatment groups with 7 and 10 rats had thyroxin and thiouracil in their drinking water, respectively. The main difficulty in modeling their growth curves is the fanning effect, which indicates an increase in variances over time. To stabilize the variances, Box (1950) considers differencing based on the data at the initial week and Wolfinger (1996) illustrates the logarithmic transformation and discusses ways to model the growth curve without relying on the data transformation.
