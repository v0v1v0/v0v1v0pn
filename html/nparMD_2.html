<h2>Nonparametric Test For Multivariate Data With Two-Way Layout Factorial Design - Small Samples</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Analysis of multivariate data with two-way completely randomized
factorial design - version for small samples. The analysis is based on fully nonparametric, rank-based methods and
uses a N(0,1)-approximation for test statistics based on 'Dempster's ANOVA', 'Wilk's Lambda', 'Lawley-Hotelling' and
'Bartlett-Nanda-Pillai' criteria. This approximation is established by the asymptotic distribution
of these four statistics under true null-hypothesis if one of the explanatory factors has a large number
of levels. The multivariate response is allowed to be ordinal, quantitative, binary or a mixture
of the different variable types. The test statistics are constructed using nonparametric relative effect estimators.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">nparms(formula,data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class "formula" with two explanatory variables (factors), see examples.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class "data.frame" containing the variables in the formula</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This method is only implemented for complete data sets without missing values. The data is analysed for main effects
and interaction effect of the explanatory factors. In each case the null hypothesis "no effect" is testet. The explanatory factor 
that has the higher number of levels is automatically designated as factor "A". The covariance matrix
estimation requires at least 4 observations (observation vectors) per factor level combination. As the estimation is very time-consuming
for large groups it is performed wih a random selection of observations when a group exceeds a size of 6 observation vectors.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a list of data frames providing the values of the test statistics, p-values, degrees of freedom, factor levels,
and groupsize per factor level combination.
