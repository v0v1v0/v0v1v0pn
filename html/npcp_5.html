<h2>Nonparametric Tests for Change-Point Detection in the
Distribution of Independent Block Maxima</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Nonparametric tests for change-point detection in the distribution of
independent block maxima based either on the probability weighted
moment method (see the second reference) or on the generalized
probability weighted moment method (see the first reference) for
estimating the parameters of the generalized extreme value (GEV)
distribution. It is assumed that the block maxima are independent and
that their unknown distribution functions (d.f.s) are continuous, but not
necessarily that they are GEV distributed. Three statistics are
computed. Under the assumption that the block maxima are GEV
distributed, these are statistics particularly sensitive to changes in
the location, scale and shape parameters of the GEV. Details can be
found in third reference.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cpBlockMax(x, method = c("pwm", "gpwm"), r = 10)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector representing independent block maxima whose
unknown d.f.s are assumed continuous.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>a string specifying how statistics will be defined; can
be either <code>"pwm"</code> (the probability weighted moment method) or
<code>"gpwm"</code> (the generalized probability weighted moment method).
The method <code>"pwm"</code> is suggested for climate block maxima
that are typically not too heavy tailed, more precisely, whose
distributions are in
the maximum domains of attraction of GEV distributions with shape parameters
smaller than a half. The method <code>"gpwm"</code> should be preferred
otherwise.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>r</code></td>
<td>
<p>strictly positive integer specifying the set of breakpoints
that will be tested; more precisely, starting from the initial
sample of block maxima, the tests compare subsamples formed by the
<code>k</code> first maxima and <code>n-k</code> last maxima
for <code>k</code> in the set <code>{r,...,n-r}</code>, where <code>n</code>
is the sample size.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Approximate p-values are computed
from the estimated asymptotic null distributions, which involve the
Kolmogorov distribution. The latter is dealt with reusing code from
the <code>ks.test()</code> function; credit to RCore.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of <code>class</code> <code>htest</code> which is a list,
some of the components of which are
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>statistic</code></td>
<td>
<p>value of the three test statistics.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pvalues</code></td>
<td>
<p>corresponding approximate p-values.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stats.loc</code></td>
<td>
<p>the values of the <code>n - (2 * r - 1)</code> intermediate
change-point statistics sensitive to changes in the location;
the first test statistic is defined as the maximum of those.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stats.scale</code></td>
<td>
<p>the values of the <code>n - (2 * r - 1)</code> intermediate
change-point statistics sensitive to changes in the scale;
the second test statistic is defined as the maximum of those.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stats.shape</code></td>
<td>
<p>the values of the <code>n - (2 * r - 1)</code> intermediate
change-point statistics sensitive to changes in the shape;
the third test statistic is defined as the maximum of those.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The tests were derived under the assumption of block maxima with
continuous d.f., which implies that ties
occur with probability zero. A way to deal with ties based on
randomization is proposed in the third reference.
