<h2>Sarcoma Dataset
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that represents 1% of all adult solid malignancies (Choy, 2014). If a tumor can be surgically removed to render the patient with sarcoma free of detectable disease, 5 years is the survival time at which sarcoma oncologists assume long-term remissions.
<code>sarcoma</code> dataset contains the observed survival time of 232 patients until death from sarcoma, and covariates such as the age at diagnosis. Patients tumor free for more than 5 years were assumed to be long-term survivors (known to be cured, <code>xinu = 1</code>).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">    sarcoma
    data(sarcoma, package = "npcurePK")
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 232 rows and 4 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>x</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Age (years) of patients at diagnosis.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>t</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Observed time until death from sarcoma.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>d</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Censoring status (0 = censored, 1 = death from sarcoma).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>xinu</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Cure status (0 = dead or unknown, 1 = tumor free for
more than 5 years).
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
