<h2>Chicks' weight data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This real data is reported by Chang and Yen (2011). Eighteen chicks were randomly assigned to three treatments with six chicks in each for balanced data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("chicks")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 18 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>diet</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Diets of different protein content</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>weight</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Chicks' weight (in grams)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Treatment 1 (Diet 1) had the diet with the lowest level of protein; treatment 2 (Diet 2) had the diet with a medium level of protein; and treatment 3 (Diet 3) had the diet with the highest level of protein. Does the average weight of chicks increase with the amount of protein? Hypothesis is being investigated.
