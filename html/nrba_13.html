<h2>Fit a regression model to predict survey outcomes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A regression model is fit to the sample data to
predict outcomes measured by a survey.
This model can be used to identify auxiliary variables that are
predictive of survey outcomes and hence are potentially useful
for nonresponse bias analysis or weighting adjustments. <br></p>
<p>Only data from survey respondents will be used to fit the model,
since survey outcomes are only measured among respondents. <br></p>
<p>The function returns a summary of the model, including overall tests
for each variable of whether that variable improves the model's
ability to predict response status in the population of interest (not just in the random sample at hand). <br></p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">predict_outcome_via_glm(
  survey_design,
  outcome_variable,
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  outcome_to_predict = NULL,
  numeric_predictors = NULL,
  categorical_predictors = NULL,
  model_selection = "main-effects",
  selection_controls = list(alpha_enter = 0.5, alpha_remain = 0.5, max_iterations = 100L)
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>survey_design</code></td>
<td>
<p>A survey design object created with the <code>survey</code> package.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outcome_variable</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of an outcome variable to use as the dependent variable in the model
The value of this variable is expected to be <code>NA</code> (i.e. missing)
for all cases other than eligible respondents.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outcome_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either <code>"binary"</code> or <code>"continuous"</code>. For <code>"binary"</code>,
a logistic regression model is used. For <code>"continuous"</code>, a generalized linear model
is fit using using an identity link function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outcome_to_predict</code></td>
<td>
<p>Only required if <code>outcome_type="binary"</code>.
Specify which category of <code>outcome_variable</code> is to be predicted.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>numeric_predictors</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of names of numeric auxiliary variables to use for predicting response status.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>categorical_predictors</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of names of categorical auxiliary variables to use for predicting response status.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model_selection</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string specifying how to select a model.
The default and recommended method is 'main-effects', which simply includes main effects
for each of the predictor variables. <br>
The method <code>'stepwise'</code> can be used to perform stepwise selection of variables for the model.
However, stepwise selection invalidates p-values, standard errors, and confidence intervals,
which are generally calculated under the assumption that model specification is predetermined.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>selection_controls</code></td>
<td>
<p>Only required if <code>model-selection</code> isn't set to <code>"main-effects"</code>.
Otherwise, a list of parameters for model selection to pass on to <code>stepwise_model_selection</code>,
with elements <code>alpha_enter</code>, <code>alpha_remain</code>, and <code>max_iterations</code>.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>See Lumley and Scott (2017) for details of how regression models are fit to survey data.
For overall tests of variables, a Rao-Scott Likelihood Ratio Test is conducted
(see section 4 of Lumley and Scott (2017) for statistical details)
using the function <code>regTermTest(method = "LRT", lrt.approximation = "saddlepoint")</code>
from the 'survey' package. <br></p>
<p>If the user specifies <code>model_selection = "stepwise"</code>, a regression model
is selected by adding and removing variables based on the p-value from a
likelihood ratio rest. At each stage, a single variable is added to the model if
the p-value of the likelihood ratio test from adding the variable is below <code>alpha_enter</code>
and its p-value is less than that of all other variables not already in the model.
Next, of the variables already in the model, the variable with the largest p-value
is dropped if its p-value is greater than <code>alpha_remain</code>. This iterative process
continues until a maximum number of iterations is reached or until
either all variables have been added to the model or there are no unadded variables
for which the likelihood ratio test has a p-value below <code>alpha_enter</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame summarizing the fitted regression model. <br></p>
<p>Each row in the data frame represents a coefficient in the model.
The column <code>variable</code> describes the underlying variable
for the coefficient. For categorical variables, the column <code>variable_category</code>
indicates the particular category of that variable for which a coefficient is estimated. <br></p>
<p>The columns <code>estimated_coefficient</code>, <code>se_coefficient</code>,
<code>conf_intrvl_lower</code>, <code>conf_intrvl_upper</code>, and <code>p_value_coefficient</code>
are summary statistics for the estimated coefficient. Note that <code>p_value_coefficient</code>
is based on the Wald t-test for the coefficient. <br></p>
<p>The column <code>variable_level_p_value</code> gives the p-value of the
Rao-Scott Likelihood Ratio Test for including the variable in the model.
This likelihood ratio test has its test statistic given by the column
<code>LRT_chisq_statistic</code>, and the reference distribution
for this test is a linear combination of <code>p</code> F-distributions
with numerator degrees of freedom given by <code>LRT_df_numerator</code>
and denominator degrees of freedom given by <code>LRT_df_denominator</code>,
where <code>p</code> is the number of coefficients in the model corresponding to
the variable being tested.
