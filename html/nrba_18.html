<h2>t-test of differences in estimated means/percentages from two different sets of replicate weights.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Tests whether estimates of means/percentages differ systematically between two sets of replicate weights:
an original set of weights, and the weights after adjustment (e.g. post-stratification or nonresponse adjustments) and possibly subsetting (e.g. subsetting to only include respondents).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">t_test_of_weight_adjustment(
  orig_design,
  updated_design,
  y_vars,
  na.rm = TRUE,
  null_difference = 0,
  alternative = "unequal",
  degrees_of_freedom = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>orig_design</code></td>
<td>
<p>A replicate design object created with the <code>survey</code> package.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>updated_design</code></td>
<td>
<p>A potentially updated version of <code>orig_design</code>,
for example where weights have been adjusted for nonresponse or updated using post-stratification.
The type and number of sets of replicate weights must match that of <code>orig_design</code>.
The number of rows may differ (e.g. if <code>orig_design</code> includes the full sample but <code>updated_design</code> only includes respondents).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y_vars</code></td>
<td>
<p>Names of dependent variables for tests. For categorical variables, percentages of each category are tested.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>na.rm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to drop cases with missing values for a given dependent variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>null_difference</code></td>
<td>
<p>The difference between the two means/percentages under the null hypothesis. Default is <code>0</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alternative</code></td>
<td>
<p>Can be one of the following: <br></p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>'unequal'</code> (the default): two-sided test of whether difference in means is equal to <code>null_difference</code> <br></p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>'less'</code>: one-sided test of whether difference is less than <code>null_difference</code> <br></p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>'greater'</code>: one-sided test of whether difference is greater than <code>null_difference</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>degrees_of_freedom</code></td>
<td>
<p>The degrees of freedom to use for the test's reference distribution.
Unless specified otherwise, the default is the design degrees of freedom minus one,
where the design degrees of freedom are estimated using the <code>survey</code> package's <code>degf</code> method
applied to the 'stacked' design formed by combining <code>orig_design</code> and <code>updated_design</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame describing the results of the t-tests, one row per dependent variable.
</p>


<h3>Statistical Details</h3>

<p>The t-statistic used for the test has as its numerator the difference in means/percentages between the two samples, minus the <code>null_difference</code>.
The denominator for the t-statistic is the estimated standard error of the difference in means.
Because the two means are based on overlapping groups and thus have correlated sampling errors, special care is taken to estimate the covariance of the two estimates.
For designs which use sets of replicate weights for variance estimation, the two means and their difference are estimated using each set of replicate weights;
the estimated differences from the sets of replicate weights are then used to estimate sampling error with a formula appropriate to the replication method (JKn, BRR, etc.). <br><br>
This analysis is not implemented for designs which use linearization methods for variance estimation.
<br>
Unless specified otherwise using the <code>degrees_of_freedom</code> parameter, the degrees of freedom for the test are set to the design degrees of freedom minus one.
Design degrees of freedom are estimated using the <code>survey</code> package's <code>degf</code> method. <br><br>
See Van de Kerckhove et al. (2009) for an example of this type of nonresponse bias analysis (among others).
See Lohr and Riddles (2016) for the statistical details of this test.
