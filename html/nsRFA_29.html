<h3>Details</h3>

<p><b>Supported cases</b>
</p>
<p>These functions are taking 4 cases into account, depending on the type of data provided:
- Using only the systematic data: xcont provided, xhist=NA, infhist=NA and suphist=NA
- Using censored information, historical flood known: xcont and xhist provided, infhist=NA and suphist=NA
- Using censored information, historical flood unknown precisely but its lower limit known: xcont and infhist provided, xhist=NA and suphist=NA
- Taking into account flood estimation intervals: infhist and suphist (respectively lower and upper limits) provided, xcont provided, xhist=NA  
- Please note that every other case is NOT supported. For example, you can't have some historical flood values perfectly known as well as some other for which you only know a lower limit or an interval.
</p>
<p>Regarding the perception thresholds:
- By definition, the number of exceedances of each perception threshold within its application period has to be known precisely, and all the floods exceeding the threshold have to be included in xhist (or infhist or suphist).  
- Several thresholds are allowed.
- It is possible to include in xhist (or infhist or suphist) historical values that do not exceed the associated perception threshold.
- If for one or several thresholds you only know that this or these threshold have never been exceeded and no more information is available on floods that did not exceed the threshold(s), this case is also supported. In this case, put for the historical flood corresponding to the threshold xhist=-1 (or infhist=-1 or infhist=suphist=-1). 
</p>
<p><b>Bayesian inference</b>
</p>
<p>Bayesian inference uses a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in a hypothesis before evidence has been observed and calculates a numerical estimate of the degree of belief in the hypothesis after evidence has been observed.
The name ‘Bayesian’ comes from the frequent use of Bayes' theorem in the inference process.
In our case the problem is: which is the probability that a frequency function <code class="reqn">P</code> (of type defined in <code>dist</code>) has parameters <code class="reqn">\theta</code>, given that we have observed the realizations <code class="reqn">D</code> (defined in <code>xcont</code>, <code>xhist</code>, <code>infhist</code>, <code>suphist</code>, <code>nbans</code>, <code>seuil</code>).
The Bayes' theorem writes
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">P(\theta|D) = \frac{P(D|\theta) \cdot P(\theta)}{P(D)}</code>
</p>

<p>where 
<code class="reqn">P(\theta|D)</code> is the conditional probability of <code class="reqn">\theta</code>, given <code class="reqn">D</code> (it is also called the posterior probability because it is derived from or depends upon the specified value of <code class="reqn">D</code>) and is the result we are interested in;
<code class="reqn">P(\theta)</code> is the prior probability or marginal probability of <code class="reqn">\theta</code> (‘prior’ in the sense that it does not take into account any information about <code class="reqn">D</code>), and can be given using the input <code>apriori</code> (it can be used to account for causal information); 
<code class="reqn">P(D|\theta)</code> is the conditional probability of <code class="reqn">D</code> given <code class="reqn">\theta</code> and it is defined choosing <code>dist</code> and depending on the availability of historical data;
<code class="reqn">P(D)</code> is the prior or marginal probability of <code class="reqn">D</code>, and acts as a normalizing constant.
Intuitively, Bayes' theorem in this form describes the way in which one's beliefs about observing <code class="reqn">\theta</code> are updated by having observed <code class="reqn">D</code>.
</p>
<p>Since complex models cannot be processed in closed form by a Bayesian analysis, namely because of the extreme difficulty in computing the normalization factor <code class="reqn">P(D)</code>, simulation-based Monte Carlo techniques as the MCMC approaches are used.
</p>
<p><b>MCMC Metropolis algorithm</b>
</p>
<p>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (which include random walk Monte Carlo methods), are a class of algorithms for sampling from probability distributions based on constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution. The state of the chain after a large number of steps is then used as a sample from the desired distribution.
The quality of the sample improves as a function of the number of steps.
</p>
<p>The MCMC is performed here through a simple Metropolis algorithm, i.e. a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with symmetric proposal density.
The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm can draw samples from any probability distribution <code class="reqn">P(x)</code>, requiring only that a function proportional to the density can be calculated at <code class="reqn">x</code>.
In Bayesian applications, the normalization factor is often extremely difficult to compute, so the ability to generate a sample without knowing this constant of proportionality is a major virtue of the algorithm.
The algorithm generates a Markov chain in which each state <code class="reqn">x_t + 1</code> depends only on the previous state <code class="reqn">x_t</code>.
The algorithm uses a Gaussian proposal density <code class="reqn">N(x_t, \sigma_x)</code>, which depends on the current state <code class="reqn">x_t</code>, to generate a new proposed sample <code class="reqn">x'</code>.
This proposal is accepted as the next value <code class="reqn">x_t + 1 = x'</code> if <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> drawn from <code class="reqn">U(0,1)</code> satisfies
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\alpha &lt; \frac{P(x')}{P(x_t)}</code>
</p>

<p>If the proposal is not accepted, then the current value of <code class="reqn">x</code> is retained (<code class="reqn">x_t + 1 = x_t</code>).
</p>
<p>The Markov chain is started from a random initial value <code class="reqn">x_0</code> and the algorithm is run for many iterations until this initial state is forgotten. 
These samples, which are discarded, are known as burn-in. 
The remaining set of accepted values of <code class="reqn">x</code> represent a sample from the distribution <code class="reqn">P(x)</code>.
As a Gaussian proposal density (or a lognormal one for definite-positive parameters) is used, the variance parameter <code class="reqn">\sigma_x^2</code> has to be tuned during the burn-in period.
This is done by calculating the acceptance rate, which is the fraction of proposed samples that is accepted in a window of the last <code class="reqn">N</code> samples. 
The desired acceptance rate depends on the target distribution, however it has been shown theoretically that the ideal acceptance rate for a one dimensional Gaussian distribution is approx 50%, decreasing to approx 23% for an N-dimensional Gaussian target distribution.
If <code class="reqn">\sigma_x^2</code> is too small the chain will mix slowly (i.e., the acceptance rate will be too high, so the sampling will move around the space slowly and converge slowly to <code class="reqn">P(x)</code>).
If <code class="reqn">\sigma_x^2</code> is too large the acceptance rate will be very low because the proposals are likely to land in regions of much lower probability density.
The desired acceptance rate is fixed here to 34%.
</p>
<p>The MCMC algorithm is based on a code developed by Eric Gaume on Scilab.
It is still unstable and not all the distributions have been tested.
