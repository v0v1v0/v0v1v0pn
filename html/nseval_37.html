<h2>Making function calls, with full control of argument scope.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The functions <code>do</code> and <code>do_</code> construct and invoke a function call.
In combination with dots and quotation objects they allow you
to control the scope of the function call and each of its arguments
independently.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">do(...)

do_(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>A function to call and list(s) of arguments to pass. All
should be <code>quotation</code> or <code>dots</code> objects, except the first
argument for <code>do</code> which is quoted literally.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For <code>do_</code> all arguments should be <code>quotation</code> or <code>dots</code> objects, or
convertible to such using <code>as.quo()</code>. They will be concatenated
together by c.dots to form the call list (a <code>dots</code> object).
For <code>do</code> the first argument is quoted literally, but the
rest of the arguments are evaluated the same way as <code>do_</code>.
</p>
<p>The head, or first element of the call list, represents the
function, and it should evaluate to a function object. The rest of
the call list is used as that function's arguments.
</p>
<p>When a quotation is used as the first element, the call is evaluated
from the environment given in that quotation. This means that calls
to <code>caller()</code> (or <code>parent.frame()</code>) from within that function
should return that environment.
</p>
<p><code>do</code> is intended to be a replacement for base function do.call.
For instance these two lines are similar in effect:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>do.call("complex", list(imaginary = 1:3))
do(complex, dots(imaginary = 1:3))
</pre></div>
<p>As are all these:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>do.call("f", list(as.name("A")), envir = env)
do_(quo(f, env), quo(A, env)):
do_(dots_(list(as.name("f"), as.name("A")), env))
do_(dots_(alist(f, A), env))
</pre></div>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The return value of the call.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>When the environment of the call head differs from that of
the arguments, <code>do</code> may make a temporary binding of <code>...</code> to pass
arguments. This will cause some primitive functions, like (
<code>&lt;-</code>, or <code>for</code>), to fail with an error like
"'...' used an in incorrect context," because these primitives do
not understand how to unpack <code>...</code>. To avoid the use of <code>...</code>,
ensure that all args have the same environment as the call head,
or are forced.
</p>
<p>For the specific case of calling <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠&lt;-⁠</code>, you can use <code>set_</code> to
make assignments.
