<h2>numGen: A package for generating number series items.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The numGen package provides 14 item models for generating number series items.
</p>


<h3>Item model 1</h3>

<p>This number series generates simple linear sequences with a magnitude of up to 5000.<br><code>imOne</code>
</p>


<h3>Item model 2</h3>

<p>This number series generate sequences consist of elements belonging to two homogeneous groups with equal number of elements.<br><code>imTwo</code>
</p>


<h3>Item model 3</h3>

<p>This function allows you to select one of the four arithmetic operators following a sequence succession rule.<br><code>imThree</code>
</p>


<h3>Item model 4</h3>

<p>This create items that relates to comprehension of abstract object representation (Item model 5) and Identification of co-occurring relationships between elements (Item model 4).<br><code>imFour</code>
</p>


<h3>Item model 5</h3>

<p>Generate items with two sequences combined into one number series.<br><code>imFive</code>
</p>


<h3>Item model 6</h3>

<p>This model uses the addition and substraction (Arithmetic) operator, Linear pattern and Progressive coefficient to create the number series.<br><code>imSix</code>
</p>


<h3>Item model 7</h3>

<p>This function creates number series that is a combination of Arithmetic, Linear and Complex coefficient. <br>
First logic of complex coefficient = i*x+y.<br>
Second logic of complex coefficient = (i+x)*y.<br><code>imSeven</code>
</p>


<h3>Item model 8</h3>

<p>This is based on the categorical / pattern recognition rule. Neighbouring pairs or triads of objects are related, includes arithmetic operations. <br><code>imEight</code>
</p>


<h3>Item model 9</h3>

<p>This function creates Fibonacci sequences. The maximum number to be generated is 15 items.<br><code>imNine</code>
</p>


<h3>Item model 10</h3>

<p>The number series is a combination of Arithmetic, linear sequence and progressive coefficient. <br>
First logic is combining sequences x y x y x y x y = one simple (cannot be controlled), one progressive. <br>
Second logic is combining sequences x y x y x y x y = two progressive. <br><code>imTen</code>
</p>


<h3>Item model 11</h3>

<p>Neighbouring objects + 2-sequence coefficient. <br>
This function creates number series that is a combination of Neighbouring objects + 2-sequence coefficient. <br>
Multiplication and Division is removed since the calculated value is too big. <br><code>imEleven</code>
</p>


<h3>Item model 12</h3>

<p>This function creates number series that is a irregular combination of sequences a b b a b b a ... <br>
Only the addition and substraction arithmetic operators are used to create the number series items. <br><code>imTwelve</code>
</p>


<h3>Item model 13</h3>

<p>Combination of sequences and ratios. <br><code>imThirteen</code>
</p>
