<h2>Tools to Format Numbers for Publication</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Format numbers and plots for publication; includes the removal of leading zeros,
standardization of number of digits, addition of affixes, and a p-value
formatter.  These tools combine the functionality of several 'base' functions
such as <code>paste</code>, <code>format</code>, and
<code>sprintf</code> into specific use case functions that are named in
a way that is consistent with usage, making their names easy to remember and
easy to deploy.
