<h2>Select the axes of the coordinate frame E</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function returns the axes of the coordinate frame E (Earth-Centered,
Earth-Fixed, ECEF).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">R_Ee(axes = "e")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>axes</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either 'e' or 'E'
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> 'e': z-axis points to the North Pole along the Earth's rotation axis,
x-axis points towards the point where latitude = longitude = 0.
This choice is very common in many fields.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 'E': x-axis points to the North Pole along the Earth's rotation axis,
y-axis points towards longitude +90deg (east) and latitude = 0.
(the yz-plane coincides with the equatorial plane).
This choice of axis ensures that at zero latitude and longitude,
frame N (North-East-Down) has the same orientation as frame E.
If roll/pitch/yaw are zero, also frame B (forward-starboard-down)
has this orientation. In this manner, the axes of frame E is
chosen to correspond with the axes of frame N and B.
The functions in this library originally used this option.

</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are two choices of E-axes that are described in Table 2 in Gade (2010):
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>e</code>: z-axis points to the North Pole and x-axis points to the point where
latitude = longitude = 0. This choice is very common in many fields.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>E</code>: x-axis points to the North Pole, y-axis points towards longitude +90deg
(east) and latitude = 0. This choice of axis directions ensures
that at zero latitude and longitude, N (North-East-Down) has the
same orientation as E. If roll/pitch/yaw are zero, also B (Body,
forward, starboard, down) has this orientation. In this manner, the
axes of E is chosen to correspond with the axes of N and B.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>rotation matrix defining the axes of the coordinate frame E as
described in Table 2 in Gade (2010)
