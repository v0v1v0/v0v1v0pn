<h2>Weight polls</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a vector of weights to use in calculating a weighted average
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">weight_polls(polldates, n = rep(1, length(polldates)), method = c("pundit",
  "curia"), refdate = Sys.Date(), electiondate = as.Date("2017-09-23"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>polldates</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of dates of polls.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of sample sizes of polls.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>which weighting method to use; either that used in 2017 by Curia or Pundit 
(two New Zealand poll aggregators).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>refdate</code></td>
<td>
<p>date against which to compare polling dates (both methods give more weight
to more recent polls).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>electiondate</code></td>
<td>
<p>date of the next election (the Curia weighting method gives more weight
to polls close to the election).</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is experimental and so far it has not been possible to match published 
results.  Use with caution.
</p>
<p>This function is to facilitate reproduction of existing poll aggregation methods.
</p>
<p>Both methods provide weights proportional to the sample sizes.
</p>
<p>The Pundit Poll of Polls states its method is an adaptation of that used by 
fivethirtyeight.  It gives polls a half life of 30 days, so a poll that is 
120 days old gets 0.125 the weight of one conducted today.
</p>
<p>The Curia method gives weight of 1 to all polls that are seven or less days old;
0 to polls older than 38 days; and a linear interpolation for inbetween.  Note that
this method gives zero weight to many older surveys that would get a weight in the 
pundit method.
</p>
<p>Caution - as at March 2017, this function had failed to exactly replicate results on the 
webpages of Curia and Pundit.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

opinion polls
