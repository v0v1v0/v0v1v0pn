<h2>Allocate seats after election</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Allocates seats in Parliament after an election using the Sainte-Lague 
allocation formula
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">allocate_seats(votes, parties = names(votes), nseats = 120,
  threshold = 0.05, electorate = rep(0, length(votes)))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>votes</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of vote proportions or counts.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parties</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of names of parties.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nseats</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of seats to allocate.  Note that in mixed systems such as New Zealand's
where <code>electorate</code> is not all zero, there may be a "hangover" and total number of seats
ends up larger than <code>nseats</code> due to parties that win an electorate seat but received less
than <code>1/nseats</code> of the vote.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>minimum proportion of votes needed to be allocated a seat.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>electorate</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of same length as parties, for use in mixed-member
proportional systems such as New Zealand's.  If the ith <code>electorate &gt; 0</code>,
the ith party is allocated seats regardless of whether the party exceeded <code>threshold</code>.
This is needed in a mixed-member proportional system such as New Zealand's.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with two elements: a data frame <code>seats_df</code> and a vector
<code>seats_v</code>, each of which provides information on the number of seats 
allocated to each party.
</p>
<p>The data frame has four columns: <code>proportionally_allocated</code>, 
<code>electorate_seats</code>, <code>final</code> and <code>party</code>.  In New Zealand, the number of
"list MPs" for each party is <code>final - electorate_seats</code>.
</p>
<p>The vector is the same as <code>final</code> in the data frame, with names equal to <code>party</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# From Wikipedia; should return 3, 2, 2:
allocate_seats(c(53000, 24000, 23000), nseats = 7, threshold = 0)

# From 2014 New Zealand election
votes &lt;- c(National = 1131501, Labour = 604535, Green = 257359,
           NZFirst = 208300, Cons = 95598, IntMana = 34094, 
           Maori = 31849, Act = 16689, United = 5286,
           Other = 20411)
electorate = c(41, 27, 0, 
               0, 0, 0, 
               1, 1, 1,
               0)
               
# Actual result:               
allocate_seats(votes, electorate = electorate)

# Result if there were no 5% minimum threshold:
allocate_seats(votes, electorate = electorate, threshold = 0)$seats_v
