<h2>New Zealand Opinion Polls</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Opinion polling of voting intention for New Zealand general elections
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">polls
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame of 7 columns</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Intended party vote.  Note the original source says 'Refusals are generally 
excluded from the party vote percentages, while question wording and the 
treatment of "don't know" responses and those not intending to vote may vary 
between survey organisations.'
</p>
<p><code>EndData</code> and <code>StartDate</code> refer to the data collection period.  These
dates were entered by hand, use with caution and check against the <code>WikipediaDates</code> 
column which is the version from the original source.
</p>
<p>Where the date in Wikipedia is given only as "released on X", the start and end dates
have been deemed to be two days before release.
</p>
<p>The data for the 2005 election are particularly unreliable and in some cases it is not 
clear whether some parties have been omitted.  For example, the Digipoll from 22 March 
to 30 March 2005 has figures only for National and Labour (47.5 and 34.5).
